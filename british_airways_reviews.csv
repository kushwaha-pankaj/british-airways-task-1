Caleb Lowe,United Kingdom,21st February 2024,Yes, Have no fear when your BA flight is operated byFinnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.,A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Malaga to London Heathrow,February 2024,1,5,5,4,1,4,yes
Clarke Roper,United Kingdom,29th January 2024,Yes," I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though.",Boeing 777-200,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,London Gatwick to Cancun,January 2024,1,4,4,1,4,4,yes
Muhammad Yasin,United Kingdom,12th January 2024,No,"Not Verified| Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills.",A350-1000,Business,Economy Class,Glasgow to London,January 2024,1,4,3,4,4,3,no
V Simpson,United States,23rd December 2023,Yes,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain.",Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,Lisbon to Houston via London Heathrow,November 2023,1,2,4,3,1,1,no
H Miller,United Kingdom,12th December 2023,Yes,"Once again a terrible business class experience with BA. The flight was delayed by 4.5 hours, The plane was very old with problems with at least 4 of the seats in business class not cleaned properly prior to departure. Food was terrible as always with BA and only one choice available from advertised menu. As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from Heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day - which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional 4 hour delay whilst at Heathrow. At no point were we advised about our compensation rights (despite asking at check in and connections) or provided any vouchers during the delays. Having flown Etihad, Qatar and Virgin business class equivalents over the last year it is clear to see how big the gulf now is between BA and its rivals.",A380,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Miami to Manchester via Heathrow,December 2023,1,3,2,1,1,2,no
Bert Vissers,Switzerland,26th November 2023,Yes,"Dear Community I feel compelled to share the utter frustration and disappointment that defined my recent travel experience with British Airways. Buckle up, folks; this one's a rollercoaster. On July 16 and 17, 2023, I had the displeasure of flying with British Airways on BA709 and BA7, and let me tell you, it was a nightmare. The initial flight from Zurich (ZRH) to London (LHR) on BA709 faced a seemingly unavoidable one-hour delay upon arrival at LHR. This, of course, resulted in me missing my connection to Tokyo, triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to Tokyo (HND) via Beijing with Air China. Oh, but the fun didn't stop there — flight CA183 was also delayed, turning my 16-hour delay into a grand total of 23 hours, finally arriving in Tokyo at 23:00 instead of the promised 7:10. And the cherry on top? My four checked-in suitcases decided to take a detour and didn't join me in Tokyo, forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the baggage center. I finally got my lost luggage back on July 23, because why make it easy, right? But wait, there's more! My return flight from Tokyo to Zurich (BA8) on August 8 also danced to the delay tune, making me question if punctuality is just a myth for British Airways. The cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans, stealing a whole day of scheduled activities, including a guided Tokyo tour. As if that weren't enough, I had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expenses—extra airport transfers, tour operator assistance fees, emergency purchases, airport meals, and international calls for rearrangements. The lack of assistance at LHR airport was the icing on this bitter cake. Installing the BA app just to get basic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle, and the fact that no BA clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating. British Airways, you've left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet. Here's hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now, it's not a good look. Frustrated and fed up, Bert",A380,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Zürich to Tokyo Haneda via London,July 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Massimo Tricca,Italy,5th November 2023,No,"Not Verified|  Angry, disappointed, and unsatisfied. My route was from London to Atlanta. My suitcase was not boarded, therefore not landed with me. For both comfort and safety reason, a bag always fly with its passenger and that did not happen. Claims and few phone calls were made by desk assistants who answered my questions unprofessionally and miserably. Certainly, I was left with nothing but my backpack which contained not more than few snacks. Neither clothes nor anything else was ever provided as an apology. Meanwhile, I was also told that my bag would have been delivered through the next 24 hours which also did not happen. British Airways is a great airline to fly with but its organization, when it comes to customer service, is poor and uncertain. Still waiting for my bag.",Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London Heatrow to Atlanta,November 2023,1,5,4,3,3,5,yes
Mehmet Sahiner,United Kingdom,21st October 2023,Yes," I have been using BA for a while now and on average I cannot say that I am pretty satisfied. BA somehow experience cancellations and delays most of the time. Second, the in-flight service is usually weak. Food portions are small and cabin crew is not very helpful especially when it comes to drink requests. The screens in the A380s should be renewed as they are full of scratches and same size as A321s. Especially in longer flights, the entertainment system becomes more important. There is also no welcome package except for pillow and small blanket. I would expect more from BA. If you are flying from the US to anywhere except the UK, I would recommend considering other airlines. But if you are flying to/from UK directly, then BA could be one of your choices.",A380-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to London,October 2023,1,2,2,2,1,3,no
Glenn Taylor-Biffen,United Kingdom,11th October 2023,Yes,"  The already delayed aircraft landed and apart from the small BA logo on the rear of the fuselage, there was no indication as to whom the carrier really was. Boarding turned into a farce with passenger groups being told to wait in one queue in order to board, only to be informed we were on the wrong place and our boarding wasn't allowed yet. The interior cabin was reminiscent of a BA cabin from twenty years earlier except the tight legroom and uncomfortable seating which made a budget airline feel luxurious. The crew were not BA but from an unknown charter company. Service was slow, and as usual, choices of food to purchase ran out before they'd reached row 24. I requested a cup of tea which never appeared. Thank goodness for my airport purchased water and the tiny offering of pretzels. The over officious senior flight attendant, who'd been facilitating in 'Club Europe' appeared in economy and immediately slammed down the armrests (whilst still in mid flight) making an already uncomfortable journey feel worse. ""Cattle class"" was definitely that! To say I was happy to land and disembark was an understatement. Never again BA, never again!",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Catania to Gatwick,October 2023,1,1,1,1,4,1,no
Tatiana Bobrovskaya,United Kingdom,2nd October 2023,Yes," Not a reliable airline. You cannot trust the timing at all. I had a 6.45am flight, boarding was on time, but then we are sitting in the plane for already (1.5 hours) and the expected departure is still not clear. They have discovered the engine is not working! I am risking to be late for a business meeting in Geneva. How come they bring a not working plane to the gate. The funny thing is that I had another business trip in spring 2023, also with BA to Amsterdam. When I arrived to the Airport that time - I was told I don't have a seat. I was put on the next flight in several hours, which should have get me to the business meeting late, but still not too much. A lot of stress. In the end, on the second plane we were sitting in the cabin for 1.5 hours and I have missed the meeting. I thought it was a dramatic unlucky case that time, but today I see it's routine for BA not to fly on time.",A320,Business,Economy Class,London to Geneva,October 2023,1,4,2,1,1,1,no
Selcuk Benter,Germany,20th September 2023,No,"Not Verified|  My initial flight was cancelled 8 hours prior the flight. Then I was automatically rescheduled for next day. Next day, the flight was delayed leaving Hamburg and missed my connecting flight to Las Vegas. Me and several other passengers spent the night in London. British Airways provided us with vouchers but the transfer bus dropped us at the wrong hotel (closest to our hotel) and told us that we can walk there if we want to. As a result, I lost two nights hotel reservations that I made in las Vegas. I opened a claim and provided all receipts to British Airways to get refund of my hotel reservations, but over 5 weeks now, not a single feedback from British Airways. I will avoid all flights with them in future, and will share this story.",A350,Business,Premium Economy,Hamburg to Las Vegas via London,August 2023,1,2,2,1,1,1,no
N Gassel,United Kingdom,4th September 2023,Yes," British Airways has a total lack of respect for its customers. I was booked to fly from Frankfurt Main to London City Airport, and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by BA without explanation, when I was already at the airport. The worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers. The ground staff’s attitude was that they are merely third party agents, not BA employees, and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all, telling us we had to contact BA directly via phone if we wanted help. They couldn’t even provide us a phone number, telling us to look it up on ba.com ! So BA abandoned its passengers. They did tell us that the BA departure to Heathrow had also been cancelled, meaning there would be no further BA flight from Frankfurt to London that day (although other airlines were still operating the route- but BA refused to rebook us on them). The reason given for both cancellations was “technical reasons”. No assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation, nor any information on help regarding food/ accommodation help etc. Their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem, not theirs. I received an email an hour later notifying me that I had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later, which wasn’t acceptable as I had to get back to London that night. I rang BA’s call centre and again, they showed a high degree of callousness. 95% of the half-hour call was spent with me waiting on hold, with the phone just cutting off after half an hour, and no meaningful information given to me by that point. There was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut (and I had a solid phone signal and wifi as I was still standing in Terminal 2 of Frankfurt Main airport), even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details. They just don’t care. In the end I had to arrange my own return to London by taking a coach to Hanh airport which was 112km away , waiting there for 5 hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with Ryanair to Stansted. At least that flight operated on time and got me back to London! BA is worse than a low cost carrier now.",A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to London City,September 2023,1,4,3,1,3,1,no
C Hill,United Kingdom,28th August 2023,Yes," Filthy plane, cabin staff ok, appalling customer service staff who couldn’t care less when dealing with a complaint. Paid extra for club Europe/business class. Food was poor, they gave you wipes to clean your seat area yourself and we were split up so they could accommodate families. Not really what you expect when you pay for the extra service. Will be cancelling our other bookings we have with BA, even if that means we lose our deposit.",A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Tenerife to Gatwick,August 2023,1,3,1,1,1,1,no
D Daly,United States,12th August 2023,No,"Not Verified|  Flight delayed by an hour, it happens, no biggie. Had us change our gate at the airport, never happened before but I guess it's ok. Gate agent asked us to check our bags and after telling him we would prefer not to do that, he did it anyway. Second gate agent reassigned our seats from exit row to regular which is a huge squeeze my for 6'3"" travel bud.",Embraer-190,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Paris,August 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Rajan Parrikar,Iceland,31st July 2023,Yes,"Keflavík, Iceland to London Heathrow on an A320 in Business Class. The journey got off on an unpleasant note - the Business Class line at Keflavík was so long that it looked like an Economy Class check-in. It took over 30 mins to get through. There was no lounge access offered. The boarding process was well handled. British Airways Business Class seats for the Club Europe product are terrible - exactly the same as Economy with the middle seat left vacant. You don't even get extra pitch. What made the overall product tolerable were the good onboard service and the inflight WiFi. Also the fact that the flight leaves at a convenient mid-morning time of 10:40 am.",A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Keflavik  to London,July 2023,1,5,4,2,4,3,yes
Alan Lacey,United Kingdom,20th July 2023,No,"Not Verified|  I'm sure that BA have gradually made their economy experience (BA Euroflyer out of Gatwick) so miserable that passengers are tempted to upgrade to the lacklustre and overpriced business class. Long wait at the biz checkin ( due to status ) and dealt with by a bored agent - OK third party, but still representing BA - who hardly spoke and avoided eye contact and was more focussed on her fingernails. Lounge was crowded and grubby but at least the staff there are pleasant and helpful On board the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and it took over two hours before crew appeared with food sales and the ""free water"" which on Gatwick services consists of a half full plastic cup rather than the luxury of a small bottle.. A fellow passenger mentioned the delay and the fact that they had no sandwiches for sale which prompted the flight attendant to say that the service was much better on Easyjet who do two service runs etc.",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Dalaman,June 2023,1,1,1,1,3,1,no
S Carlsen,United Kingdom,5th July 2023,Yes," We arrived at Heathrow at 0600 to find our flight to Ibiza was cancelled by BA with no explanation. As if that wasn’t galling enough, the customer service from BA at the airport was non-existent! There was no explanation, no apology and no assistance in finding an alternative flight. We’ve managed to find another flight from Stansted but that isn’t until much later today, thus wasting a chunk of our short trip. I simply don’t understand why BA don’t proactively contact their customers to notify them of a cancellation, and work with them to resolve the problem. Shocking customer service!",A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Ibiza,July 2023,1,3,3,1,5,1,no
S Layne,United States,25th June 2023,Yes," We booked on the BA website, round trip flights from Seattle to Amman with a stop in London, in Business Class. Our first flight was delayed and then diverted to NYC, and enroute my husband experienced a medical emergency. When we landed in NYC we were taken to a hospital and I stayed in constant contact with the airline agent who had arranged for the ambulance transfer. The same evening we flew back home, confirming cancellation of all remaining flights with the agent at the airport. For the next several weeks, we spoke many times with BA Customer Service, trying to obtain some kind of refund — we were met with contradictory explanations, excuses and an absence of meaningful customer service. We discovered we had been marked as “no-shows” for our flight to Amman and that our return flight was still active. We were unable to cancel the return on the website, despite booking on the website. Our phone calls were never returned, we spent a minimum of 40-60 minutes on hold for every phone call we made, our emails received only canned replies without answers or explanations, we were told it was “not possible” to receive a copy of the ticketing rules and regulations nor to speak with a supervisor, and after several weeks of this abysmal customer service I filed a complaint with the FAA. In response to my complaint I received an email from BA Customer Service explaining that they had reviewed my many requests for a “full refund” but that could not be accommodated due to the ticketing rules. They would issue flight credits - except for the portion for which we no-showed. They did not state how many credits. We never once asked for a full refund - we asked to read the rules and to receive a partial refund. We will not use the credits - we were fully refunded by our travel insurance.",A321 neo,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Amman,March 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Cosmin Stefanescu,Romania,16th June 2023,No,"Not Verified| I flew with numerous airlines, but I gotta admit, British Airways is by far the worst airline ever when it comes to customer support. I waited 3 weeks for a ticket change. Call center workers are giving you false information just so they would make you hang up. They told me I was supposed to get an email from them with the flight changes, but never got. They don't have a live chat just like American Airlines do, they don't have a online form to submit your questions, they don t have a working international number. Total garbage.",Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bucharest to Dallas via London,June 2023,1,4,3,1,1,1,no
Christopher Neep,United Kingdom,6th June 2023,Yes,"An excellent flight in Club World on British Airways. The welcome aboard was warm and that continued throughout the flight. The crew were attentive, friendly and very professional. On board food for dinner and breakfast was good and there was a well chosen selection of wines. In flight entertainment offered a great selection of films and audio. The seat/flat bed was very comfortable - British Airways have done an excellent job in the design and comfort of the suites on board the A350. I liked the sleek, minimalist design. This flight showed that BA can be among the world’s best airlines.",A350,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Vancouver to London Heathrow,May 2023,1,5,4,4,3,4,yes
B Sherry,United States,23rd May 2023,No,"Not Verified| Top Ten REASONS to not use British Airways To all: Be Aware and be on Notice- Travel at your own risk I have travelled for years on many different airlines, and I have to say that British Airways ranks as one of the top two most horrible airlines to fly. Don’t waste your time or money. Customer service is non-existent. Please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once, they have your money, you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye. We used them to travel to Europe and it was the worst experience I have had with an airline in years. When you work hard and save your money to travel, you expect a good experience. Welp not with this company. Who I am sure, makes millions on customers per year. I understand that sometimes things happen, but this started right after we booked our flight AND THE BAD EXPERIENCE DID NOT END UNTIL WE SET FOOT BACK TO OUR HOMETOWN. Please take note: #1 - The customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website. I had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered. Trust me, the number is a secret. #2 – When you FINALLY find a customer service number, there is a long wait and when or if someone answers, they will not resolve your issues. Instead, they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to. NO ONE TAKES OWNERSHIP #4- What airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesn’t have customer service reps to help you, the customer? BRITISH AIRWAYS that’s who. #5 - They will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you, AT ALL. NO EMAIL, NO TEXT. #6- If you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary, you may or may not get notifications. #7 - If you pay for seats and you pick them, it doesn’t matter, they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid. #8 - The flight may be cheaper, but it is not once you are done paying for seats. #9- They will route to another partner airline and not notify you #10 – If you have a connecting flight, they will cancel one leg and not the other and NOT NOTIFY YOU. I will never use them again. And if this review helps one person that heeds my advice, then my job is done.",A320,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Dallas to Madrid via London,May 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Harry Okin,United Kingdom,14th May 2023,Yes,"I wasn't going to bother reviewing this flight as I seem to be on a perpetual downer with BA but the airport experience convinced me otherwise. After having our flight class reduced from First to Business, then offered an alternative route on the outward leg in First to make up for the disappointment, they then reneged on this. As it was a special anniversary it sucked. Flying back we checked in online to our chosen window seats, at the gate we had to show our passports as we passport before boarding as we were hand luggage only. Trying to board we had our passports checked twice more and were issued new boarding cards for centre seats. Unbelievable! The flight itself was very quiet and only half the normal crew for this aircraft was unavailable. This meant no pre-departure drinks and a limited selection of food. The crew was great but what an earth is going on at BA, they have this unique knack to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory every time. I say this as the new club suites are great.",Boeing 787-9,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Atlanta to London,April 2023,1,3,1,1,1,1,no
C Mayre,Ireland,23rd April 2023,Yes, The ground staff were not helpful. Felt like all they wanted to do was rush us to check in and then all passengers needed up waiting in a holding area for a bus anyway. Travelling with a child with a disability was a nightmare with British Airways. Logged a complaint and it took almost four weeks to answer. Lost some of our luggage. It was not a good experience.,Dreamliner,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Denver,February 2023,1,1,1,1,1,2,no
L Horten,United States,13th April 2023,Yes," I will never fly British Airways again. To start, the plane was over 2 hours late, with no weather and no reason given. The boarding process was chaotic, both in the airport and onto the plane. But more importantly, although we were in business class, it wasn’t really business class. There were a few aisles —not separated in any way—in which they simply put a tray on the middle seat so that no one sits there. And those seats, like the rest, were extremely cramped and uncomfortable. I could not believe they called this business class.",A350,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Venice,March 2023,1,2,2,2,1,2,no
C Down,United Kingdom,31st March 2023,Yes,"Boarding at Mumbai was chaotic and badly organised. Once on board the crew announcements were professional, relaxed and informative in typical BA style. The seat was quite comfortable. It was a refurbished aircraft and the padding and materials are quite good. I was lucky that the middle seat was empty so I didn’t suffer from the new narrow seat which I think would have made it a lot less comfortable. The IFE is excellent, responsive and good quality. There is an enormous selection of TV and movies and a good number of games. WIFI is also very good not quite Netflix quality but still reasonable and I don’t think £17.99 for full flight is bad value. You can pay less if you just want short term simple messaging. Cabin crew were very good. Friendly and efficient. Catering was reasonable although on a near 10hr flight, the small (but tasty) pastry for the second meal service wasn’t really enough. Landing and processing at Heathrow was astonishingly quick - it felt like it was 3am, even though it was 6:30pm! No queues or waiting at all. Even the baggage was super quick at coming through. Overall a very solid experience in economy. Significantly better than it used to be.",Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to London,March 2023,1,5,3,4,5,5,yes
l Higgs,India,18th March 2023,Yes,"First time flying with British Airways and first time flying to the Americas from India via London Heathrow. I chose Premium Economy at a reasonable price. I was quite comfortable, however, the first leg of the flight from Mumbai to Heathrow, the plane was a bit outdated and there was only a foot rest. The second leg, from Heathrow to Nassau, the plane was brand new and my premium economy seat had a pop up leg support which was much more comfortable. Cabin service was fine - I appreciated that they didn't come through the cabin often while everyone was sleeping. The meals weren't that great to be honest. After landing in Heathrow, we had to wait on the tarmac for 45 minutes waiting for an open gate. My connection was less than an hour long! The BA staff in the Heathrow Airport helped me move through security quickly and I made it with time to spare for my next flight. When I arrived in Nassau, I found that my luggage didn't make it due to the short connection time in London. The BA baggage representative in Nassau was extremely professional and took down my claim. My luggage arrived on the next BA flight a few days later, and British Airways Nassau representative delivered it over to a charter airline which shipped it to the island I was staying on. Very impressive and efficient!",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Mumbai to Nassau via London,March 2023,1,4,2,3,1,3,yes
R Worton,United Kingdom,12th March 2023,Yes," The usual shambolic unfolding that BA has now unfortunately been come to known for. We had a long weekend flight booked to Munich that was supposed to be departing on 9th February at 19:55. This happened to be our first flight with our newborn (3 month old) daughter. It turned out to be a horror show of incompetence. Just under 3hrs before scheduled departure, the original 9th February flight was cancelled. We received an email as we were boarding the Heathrow express. I’d booked a day of holiday off work for this trip. We ended up getting doing a round trip to Paddington instead. On the way back from the cancelled flight, both me and my wife tried calling BA. Despite one of us having silver membership (possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there), I took us nearly 45 minutes to speak to someone who could help. I believe BA outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script. The result is that you might as well be speaking to an AI rather than a human. We often received the response similar to ‘computer says no’. If this is the service level for silver members I can’t imagine what a regular punter has to put up with. When the phone originally connected to a person, I had to wait 5 minutes as his computer booted up. - BA then proceeded to auto-book us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination. Our original flight was to Munich and the auto-booked replacement flight was to Salzburg. When asking the robot at the BA call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location 135km apart, they couldn’t understand my frustration.  Eventually, someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at 17:00. Not ideal as I’d wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldn’t refund us or move our booking, but at least we were going to Munich and not Salzburg. - The day of the new flight came round and, this time, we managed to get all the way to the check in desk. Upon arriving at the check in desk, we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled 4 minutes earlier. No email. No text. No notification ever arrived from BA to tell us that the flight had been cancelled. Incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened. The check in person said I should get on the app to rebook. At this point, I didn’t know whether to explode with anger or cry. Luckily, another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us. We were booked onto another flight later that evening (19:55 - BA0958). Unfortunately, that meant 5hrs in the grotty lounge with a 3 month old baby. It appears that everyone now has access to a lounge and so there’s really no difference between the lounge and a hostel, other than you get free stuff in the former. This was not a pleasant experience. We did eventually arrive in Munich and, despite asking, didn’t get our push chair/stroller delivered to the front of the plane. The plane was a characteristically BA dumping ground - they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut back on this service too. All in all, another shocking BA service. A lost day of holiday and not an an ounce of empathy/sympathy/understanding at all from any of the employees I interacted with.",A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Munich,March 2023,1,1,1,1,4,1,no
L Howard,United Kingdom,2nd March 2023,No,"Not Verified|  Flew premium, only worth the extra money for the bit of extra room. Penny pinching means there’s no other benefit - one drink service on 10 hour flight, no fizz offered before take off, poor food, boarding was badly organised. Food left on tables 30 min before landing with no tea and coffee offered. Few small cups of water passed around but nothing “premium” about this. New planes have been decorated terribly - feels like you’re in a dentist waiting room. Devoid of any personality or joy. Only fly if the only option, only fly premium if it’s not too expensive - seriously not worth much more than economy these days, especially if you’re in the middle 4.",A321neo,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,London Heathrow to Las Vegas,March 2023,1,2,1,2,1,3,no
Abs Ahmed,United Kingdom,16th February 2023,Yes,"This was my first time flying with BA & I was pleasantly surprised. Islamabad via Doha was very comfortable and the crew were great, friendly and helpful. The second flight was operated by Qatar Airways this was from Doha to Islamabad. My return journey was a direct BA flight, 46kg luggage allowance was really generous and stopped the hassle with connecting flights. Crew on this flight were really nice too. What let BA down was the food, it really was not nice, the IFE could do with some more content but that's not really a huge issue.",Boeing 787-9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Islamabad to London,February 2023,1,5,2,4,5,5,yes

C Bain,United Kingdom,8th January 2023,No,"Not Verified|  Great thing about British Airways A380 is the economy section upstairs. Get this if you can as it allows you to have small stowage cupboards at the window seats. Despite being not very old, the A380 looked tired inside. Broken side stowage, a seat that reclined uncontrollably and slow to react IFE. The food was supposed to be Christmas dinner. 3 wafer thin bits of dry turkey, 4 over cooked sprouts and some cubed potatoes. Poor in taste and quality. Mousse desert was great though. Slight issue during the snack meal. Ordered a childs option which was marked as such. Regular meal arrived as well and they were exactly the same. Asked a crew member to be told the difference was the sticker on the box. Staff were ok. Couple decent but mostly just ok. Overall, BA just seems a tad cheap these days. Great to sit upstairs but that was where the enjoyment ended. Just seemed a bit dull and like BA are just an average airline.",A380,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Chicago,December 2022,1,2,3,3,1,2,no
D Bartul,Canada,28th December 2022,Yes," Vancouver to Delhi via London. We were booked to fly from Vancouver to New Delhi via London Heathrow on Dec 22nd. We received an email on Dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the UK. I called to find out how it may impact our travel. The representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund. We called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions. We asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee. We booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent (simultaneously). He told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund. He processed the cancellation. 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldn’t be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline (we lost $1000 from cancelling the new tickets). Now, the representative claimed that he never said there won’t be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action, and that other “arrangements” will be made if there were any issues (this was new information never given to us before). We kept our British Airway tickets. The next day, we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation. We never heard back from the manager. As we logged in to check-in 15 hours before take off, we found that our VAN — LHR flight was cancelled (due to the bad weather in Vancouver). We did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change. We called BA again and asked about rearrangements for our flight, to which they offered rebooking with an additional $700-1000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave. Additionally, to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled, we had to pay about $1000 cancellation fee to get a refund. We were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out - the customer service person would take 15-20 minutes (for real) to search up each question or option we asked about. It has been a frustrating experience - we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely. We then demanded to speak to the manager, who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee. In total, we were on the phone with them for 2 days back and forth, without any resolutions. We felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers. We did not feel taken care of at all. We had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves. After all this trouble, we spent Christmas without our family and the missed the urgent reasons we were travelling for.",A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Delhi via London,December 2022,1,3,2,4,1,1,no

Connor Heward,Canada,25th November 2022,Yes," I was pleasantly surprised that the airline could maintain a steady schedule with little delay considering the time of the year and the weather. The flight from Montreal was my return flight to Scotland, but I originally booked to fly to and from Toronto, but the airline helped me cancel and I rebooked for a cheaper flight. The inflight service was pretty decent andthey do offer a blanket and pillow. As well they walk through the cabin offering drinks and handing out a small snack prior to the leading meal service. While the food was typical air plane food.

C Barton,United Kingdom,31st October 2022,Yes, London to Gibraltar on 25th October 2022. I booked my flight several months ahead of travel and was rather disappointed by the experience.  BA attempt to nickle and dime the customers with outrageous seat selection prices. Offering of a very small bottle of water and a nutribar as a breakfast and one gains the impression of where BA aim to be positioned at of late. The A320 has was no inflight entertainment or a route map. The staff disappeared for most of the flight. The flight was punctual but I felt cheated and under whelmed by the experience.,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Gibraltar,October 2022,1,1,1,3,1,3,no
L Pulliam,United States,17th October 2022,No,"Not Verified|  LHR-LAX. I prefer the Boeing 777 over the A380 as the seats don't seem too cramped. Check-in was very easy with the kiosks as was bag drop and security at Heathrow. T5 is a whole other story. Once through security its up the escalator, up the stairs, up the elevator, down the escalator get to the gate, no seating, then down an escalator and finally down the jet bridge to the plane. I have been in and out of Heathrow many times but never in T5 before. Anyway cabin crew were pleasant; drinks and meal service were fine. It was a day flight so no real sleeping and passengers were all moving around most of the flight. The entertainment system was good with decent options, so I occupied my time with several movies. Nice landing at LAX. All in all BA was just fine.",Boeing 777-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Los Angeles,October 2022,1,4,3,4,2,4,yes
L Tran,United States,25th September 2022,Yes,"This is my first time flying BA's new Club Suite, which, in my opinion, is very good. Flight to the US, including mine, departed from concourse C of Terminal 5 which did not have many shopping or dining options. However, it was quiet so finding seating was quite easy. The highlight is the Club Suite, which is spacious and provides a great deal of privacy. Meal service was slow, and everything was served on one tray, all at once. I think now is the time for them to begin to get back to pre-pandemic standard. At least the food tasted good, which was not something I previously experienced on BA flights, even in First Class.",Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow to New York JFK,September 2022,1,4,4,5,5,5,yes
P Walker,United Kingdom,6th September 2022,No,"Not Verified|  This review is for BA booking system not a flight . Today I clicked wrong date on line, my mistake and expect to pay a fee. I then go to “cancel booking” and click on the option to not receive a voucher, immediately I received a response saying my voucher is on its way. I call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and would not listen to my concerns and eventually I give up and want to book a new flight, obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher I didn’t want. However to my surprise I am unable to use this voucher because they can’t tell me what it is until I receive it at a point in the future that they can’t say when. So they now have my money and I have to re-book at full cost.

Stan Van Wyk,South Africa,4th August 2022,No,"Not Verified|  On our recommendation my son and his young family (child 4 and baby 9 months) and wife, flew BA to the USA from Cape Town, leaving yesterday evening. Just got off the call with him, after their arrival at Heathrow. Shocked at what he told us re the cabin service provided (or not!!) especially as my wife and I have used them many times a year for + 20 years of business flights from RSA, this our recommendation to him to use them for his holiday. My grandson had a coughing fit, so they asked (bell push) 4 times for glass of water - all ignored. Last one was told ""wait till drinks are served!"" Then when evening meal served - no food available for the 4 year old, which was pre-ordered online, they said nothing available and when my son explained it had been pre-ordered - the cabin staff supervisors response - ""prove it Sir"", that sealed it for us, if that’s the BA response to what’s seen as cattle class - it will permeate to our normal travel class, so our next booking will be an alternate.",Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cape Town to London Heathrow,August 2022,1,1,1,4,1,3,no
J Tydeman,United Kingdom,18th July 2022,No,Not Verified|  Reasonably smooth boarding. Meal service was smooth ad efficient but no ice or spirits available as no room on the trolley - could they have offered to serve this afterwards? Seat was very uncomfortable indeed on this aircraft so got little if any sleep on the long overnight flight. Cabin crew spent much of the time between meals talking loudly at the rear galley meaning we couldn't sleep even if the seats were comfortable. This was so disrespectful and inconsiderate.,A350-1000,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sao Paulo to Heathrow,July 2022,1,2,3,3,5,3,yes
Gerald Kirby,United States,4th July 2022,No,"Not Verified|  I booked a flight for myself and my wife from Heathrow to Nairobi in Premium Economy using Frequent Flyer points. I then paid $205 to reserve two seats on our own, in a 2-4-2 configuration cabin, as I didn't want to sit in a row of 4 people if possible. A few weeks before our flight BA emailed me to say they had changed my seat selection. When I logged in to see my new seat selection I had been moved into a row of 4? The email also stated that if I wasn't happy with the new seat selection they had made for me, I could get a full refund of the money I had paid. I called to cancel the reservation, which they did, and I paid $200 cancelation fee and they refunded my frequent flyer miles. When I asked them to refund the fee for my seat reservation, they told me all seat reservation fees are non refundable.

Kemal Can,United Kingdom,24th June 2022,No,"Not Verified|  The customer service of British Airways is really bad. You can't reach any call centre agent even after waiting for 30 mins. Now, I really appreciate Emirates and Turkish Airlines after facing BA's low quality customer service. Not only the customer service but the food they offer during a long haul (LDN-JNB) is really low quality. Other airline operators which are working with Do&Co for flight catering are way better than BA. I guess BA has selected the lowest budget option from Do&Co. Overall my rating is 2/5 for BA - you can feel how stingy BA is when you fly with them. Note: Respect to their cabin crew",A350,Business,Economy Class,London to Johannesburg,June 2022,1,4,1,3,1,2,no
N Rochon,Germany,13th June 2022,No,"Not Verified|  Phoenix to London Heathrow and then to Hamburg. Despite a 4 hour layover in Heathrow, bags didn't make it onto the connecting flight. Once in Hamburg, there was no one at the baggage tracing desk and the number provided was a dead-end; no ability to leave a message or connect to an employee. A group of passengers all missing checked baggage waited in the airport and tried every outlet possible (check-in desk, other baggage tracing desks, calling, emails) for two hours to no avail. The solution for us was to fill out a sheet of paper with contact info and baggage description. Four days later, no information where my luggage is and no way to contact customer service. Absolutely miserable customer support. Our flights were alright but after such bad customer service we will never fly BA again.",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Hamburg via London,June 2022,1,2,3,1,1,1,no
Wayne Connolly,United Kingdom,30th May 2022,Yes," Check in easy at BGI due to us checking flightradar24 and finding the flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours, no notification from the airlines so other passengers arrived earlier. Easy boarding in sequence numbers. Seat is a joke for 8 hour flight, no leg room on isle seat of 4, the seat in front frame blocks you stretching your legs and once the passenger in front reclines its even worse. Food is mediocre with poor choice and all of the drink choices had run out before the stewardess had arrived to my seat (only choice Coca-Cola, water or red wine. The connecting flight from LHR - MAN was cancelled with no contact from the airline, I only found out trying to book a seat on the return legs, with no alternative flight provided. We had to privately book a taxi from LHR to Manchester for 4 persons as this worked out cheaper than the train. The outbound flight was also a farce, no mention of Terminal change at LHR from 5 to 3, so quick turnaround changing terminals was chaotic and stressful for older relatives travelling with us. Overall shocking from British Airways and can guarantee I will never use them again.",Boeing 777-300,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bridgetown to London,May 2022,1,5,1,3,1,1,no
G Berhler,United Kingdom,9th May 2022,Yes," This flight was not affected by recent problems with BA and I was quite impressed by the British Airways Premium Economy product in a new Boeing 787. Overall, Premium Economy turned out to be premium and clearly a step up from Economy towards Business Class. Also, the Premium Economy product came across much better in the Boeing 787 than in the old B747 or even than in the B777. Seat was very comfortable and had nice leg room. Food, service and entertainment options were good. Clearly worth the extra money for Premium Economy.",Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,London to Mexico City,April 2022,1,4,4,4,4,4,yes
Paul MacInnes,United Kingdom,23rd April 2022,Yes,"Business lounge was closed at Pisa airport which was probably beyond the control of British Airways but as it had been closed since January the least British Airways could have done would have issued their customers who paid for this service vouchers to be used at the airport, I complained about this to BA and as compensation they said they would credit my account with 10000 Avios points which I felt was an adequate compensation and at that point felt BA had handled the situation in a prompt and professional manner. However that was seven weeks ago and no Avios points have been added to my account, I have called their call centre multiple times at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department, when the phone was answered I was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number which was read out to me which was the same number I was calling! This scenario has replayed itself probably about twenty times now, it is clear that BA have no intention of resolving this and are just making their customer go round in circles before they give up, This airline is absolutely appalling in the way it treats its customers.",A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Pisa to London Heathrow,March 2022,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Nicholas Coveyduck,France,8th April 2022,Yes," The short haul flights were the best with the crew on the final leg giving the excellent service that we all hope for. We chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the Club World Suits not the Ying Yang arrangement that they still offer. At the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago! Most business class offer 4 across but this layout still squeezes in 8 across. As we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in Business Class we always lose out on the ""Points game"" but I take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats. The points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us Bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us. This status would have allowed us to book the seats 7 days prior to departure, when they were still available, rather than the 24 hours when they were not available. On the long haul return flight I was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant. I asked if I could move and was told by the FA she would check. Nothing happened but after take-off a passenger was moved from economy to that seat. Judging by the interaction between them I would bet it was someone on Staff Travel. I think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this. Take-off was just after 1930 hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal. Had we done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it. In summary would I ever fly with BA again? No, not if I had half a chance of going with another airline.",A320 / Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Phoenix to Paris via London,April 2022,1,2,2,2,3,2,no

The infrastructure however is appalling. ZRH-LHR impossible to check-in online and just 2 staff to check-in everyone for 2 flights resulting in mislabelled luggage and an hour delay to sort this out. GVA-LHR, 2.5hrs late as no-one at LHR to tow the aircraft to the gate. LHR-ZRH, 50mins late due to slow gate staff. Even when you check-in online you have to queue at the airport to get the actual boarding pass! There are more examples, and for this reason, until they sort out their stressed ground staff, it is impossible to recommend this airline.

S Sathe,United Kingdom,27th March 2022,No,"Not Verified|  Flew BA LHR-AUS on a 787-9 on the outbound leg and then back on the A350-1000 on the return leg. Seats comfortable. Staff service on the inbound leg was disappointing. Safety briefing was missed on LHR-AUS route. LHR-AUS boarding on time, flight flew out on time, landed on time. AUS-LHR boarding one hour late, left an hour late and landed one hour late too. Food quality on both legs was not fit for human consumption. Wife ordered a veg meal which was served cold on both legs. In flight entertainment on outbound leg was bad - 2/3 screens not working. On return leg worked fine, but this is due to the A350-1000 being brand new. Good quality of sleep on both legs, which was good. Check in at LHR was flawless and without incident. Check in at AUS was rotten. We queued and were number 4 in line and waited for 1 hour for staff to check us in. What was clear is staff quality in Austin is poor, passengers did not appear to have passenger locator form(s) ready / VeriFly app ready and / or vaccine detail ready. Having looked at business and premium economy class on both legs, paying business class and premium economy did not appear worth it. Baggage was received fine at AUS and LHR - the latter took ages on return.

John Smith,United Kingdom,5th March 2022,Yes," Flight took off two hours late after what can only be described as a shambles at the airport. No airbridge to the aircraft which is not acceptable. The aircraft was better than the outbound flight, who screen was so small. After serving only about 2/3rd of the cabin, no first choice. Only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin. The airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal, so why include it as a choice. Also, to offer a roll of ham/cheese for breakfast after a 12 hour flight is cost saving. A hot breakfast should be offered. With only 90 minutes between my connecting flight, due to late arrival, I made staff aware. Whilst they let me and others passengers of the flight first, there was no staff to assist in getting us to our flight. It was a struggle to get my connecting flight. On arriving in Glasgow, got txt to say my bags did not make the flight.

David Houlihan,United Arab Emirates,13th February 2022,No,Not Verified| Having just booked BA for a return flight - being one hour each way in Club Class and paying + 700 euro for 2 persons to be then asked to pay a further 96 euro to choose seats in business. A full business class ticket and a fee for seat? A very disengaged management model.,A320,Business,Business Class,Dublin to London,February 2022,1,5,5,5,5,1,no
Ken Howie,South Africa,12th January 2022,Yes," Return trip Cape Town to Durban in Club Class highlighted the inconsistency. Our outbound trip in December was good in all respects, whereas the return trip was disappointing. Check in was fine, apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority, resulting in a long wait for our third bag. The lounge was busy, but no complaints. We went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen, where there was no sign of activity, although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time. Shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates. The informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. I checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in Durban, and flown to Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, back to Cape Town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. In fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. Boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. Drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. The food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards. With the price of good wines in South Africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine. Lunch service was quick, but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested. Overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew",Boeing 737-800,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Cape Town to Durban,January 2022,1,2,3,4,1,3,yes
T Sharp,United Kingdom,29th December 2021,Yes,"Very nice return flight with BA. To add to my previous review, I really like how BA organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups, this is super comfortable as 100+ passengers don’t jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there. The A320 was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting. Row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus, makes the 1-hour hop very comfortable. Once again, amazing staff, and they were even more attentive and accommodating to Gold level passengers: always coming and asking if any help is needed. Lovely humus, beetroot and quinoa salad for food. Great WiFi at really competitive pricing + I think it is great that they also have food / alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classes.

The steward had the temerity to blame the food supplier - as if BA could not get a better one! On the return, boarding from the back, not by priority, then, seated in row 12, I had the last half glass of champagne (only because one of the other passengers in row 12 had declined).

Rohith Jayawardene,United Kingdom,7th October 2021,Yes,"This was my first flight during the pandemic, so it was understandable the difficulties facing airlines. Check-in was longer than normal due to the vaccine checks and passenger locator forms etc. But on the return flight, it was a total mess. Just two counters open for economy and one for business. There were arguments regarding vaccine checks, where two BA staff were contradicting each other. It took an hour and ten minutes just to check in, resulting in the flight delay. On board, I was not expecting great service.  Seating was extremely uncomfortable, 29 inch pitch and 17 inch wide seats - just about bearable for an hour and a half flight.  On board service was a packet of crisps and a small bottle of water from another, no eye contact with me just handed out. However, I was pleased that disembarking passengers were let out in groups, despite a few idiots who decided to stand a up to get their hand luggage out while the aircraft is was still taxing to the gate.

A Vardana,United Kingdom,21st September 2021,Yes," Very pleasant flight to Lisbon!

However, in the air great service by the 3 male crew on a big Club class cabin. Friendly and efficient crew even to some demanding and obnoxious passengers. Late breakfast/brunch served was tasty.

Called several times but they couldn't do anything and gave us explanations like may be some one else needed those seats and there are no other seats together available.

F Lewis,United Kingdom,14th March 2021,Yes,"Absolutely appalling experience. British Airways, unfortunately, has lowered it's standards and to my dismay, I've been recently having a much better flying experience with budget airlines rather than BA.

S Peale,United Kingdom,9th December 2020,Yes," Dubai to London on 5th December. Flight was ok - seat comfortable enough, crew reasonably friendly but my food was gross.  Both flights almost full with little social distancing and plenty of mixed groups sat next to each other. Lots of passengers with masks below nose or not on at all. When coming back to Heathrow many seemed to have below their nose. Announcement made at the beginning about masks. Crew challenged a couple of people at beginning of flight for not having them on or below nose but seemed to give up at the end. When leaving plane good number had already taken off yet nothing. On way back not a single maskless or incorrectly worn mask challenged. A guy opposite me had his mask below nose the whole flight. He had a conversation with several attendants neither of whom said anything.  Not like the crew were busy either, did 2 services the whole flight then rest of the time didn’t see them. Of course flying in these times is a risk but those risks can be reduced by passengers wearing masks, enforced by the airlines.",A350,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,London Heathrow to Dubai,July 2020,1,1,1,5,4,5,no
David Jackson,Thailand,1st August 2020,Yes,"Newcastle to London Heathrow with British Airways. I was pleasantly surprised. Plane was on time and spotlessly clean.

Bret Baumbaugh,United States,12th May 2020,No,"Not Verified|  I booked my honeymoon flight from San Diego to Barcelona in September 2020. I have since needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and the uncertainty of travel, especially to other countries. I was able to change my flight at no cost, which is great. However, this is my honeymoon and I paid in advance for seats to ensure I sat next to my would be wife. This was more than $1,000 in additional cost. The response I received from British Airways is that it does not matter the reason, unless they cancel the flight, no refund or voucher is available. I then asked if I wanted to make sure I sat next to my would be wife, they expected me to pay again? The answer was yes. I'm very disappointed in the response from them during a global pandemic, where travel is not safe and we have no idea when it will be safe again.",A350,Couple Leisure,Business Class,San Diego to Barcelona via London,December 2019,1,2,1,2,1,1,no
M Irving,United Kingdom,11th April 2020,Yes,"Just before the borders were closed in South Africa due to Corona Virus, I went to the Airport to find out if the flight scheduled will fly as planned, there was no international flight customer service staff available so I was not able to get a response, the only number available was a UK number which will cost me more than a flight to enquire. Next day I managed to get on board the flight. Sadly due to my fault, I forgot my laptop inside the Aircraft on arrival to terminal 5. I was one of the last passengers to leave the plane. I realised my mistake after I passed security and I was not allowed back into the Airport to collect my laptop which is fair enough and I understand why I could not go back to the Aircraft. They gave me a number to call and I have been calling the number since March, so far it has been zero positive response because they are using a third party company to help you which has zero interest to help you find your lost items. Basically BA does not have means in place for passengers to find their items. My laptop was left inside the flight hence it is impossible for crew staff and cleaning staff to not find it hence I just can not understand how they can not find it bearing in mind it was 100% left inside the plane.

D Gold,United Kingdom,17th March 2020,Yes," Lower Deck Club Class seat, with the current awful, narrow business class facing seats. British Airways premium passengers are treated with indifference at best, and Club Class is simply terrible. My food was not fit for consumption. WIFI broken. Crew morale low. IFE quality a bad joke. To add insult to injury, the  amenity packs are contemptible. What makes BA management think that business people require, (or indeed would retain) a package of socks, mask, plastic pen, and disposable tooth brush?

S Gardner,United Kingdom,3rd March 2020,Yes,"Paris to London. Flight cancelled due to “ATC Restrictions” after Storm Ciara  and rebooked to a later flight which was delayed on top by 2 hours. Arrived in London 6 hours later than planned initially and BA refused to recognise any additional expenses because it was a forceful operational reason. Booked 3 flights to Italy for March, all cancelled. Last Thursday booked LGW/BGY/LGW and next day cancelled (for last week of March) a month away. Been a Gold Member of BA since 2016 and after seeing their constant downgrades, I will go back with AirFrance/KLM for my travel needs.

R Diaz,United States,14th February 2020,Yes," Las Vegas to Paris via London. The staff were great, but the 747 was the most uncomfortable flight in business class I’ve experienced.  The aisle seat felt like I was sitting in the aisle, a business class configuration of 2-4-2. That’s a tight squeeze. And,there were backward facing seats. The seats were not only uncomfortable but just so many things wrong with the configuration. I was just glad I didn’t pay full price for this flight.",Boeing 747-400,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Las Vegas to Paris via London,February 2020,1,4,3,4,2,1,no

The SLOW lounge at Cape Town continues to impress by the standard of service and the generous array of food and drink, including ingenious wine-dispensing machines.

The Club meal was the usual offering with the hot options displayed on a tray.

W Heale,Poland,20th January 2020,Yes," Warsaw to London. Everything went like clockwork and nothing could be disliked about this flight. Professional crew with beams on their faces, new aircraft (it's important to choose a seat no further than row 14 in A321neo, as those seats are the old type Pinnacle seats and have better legroom), very informative captain who told us about expected turbulence before we had taken off (very much appreciated), on time landing and good atmosphere on board! The food in Euro Traveller is unfortunately no longer free, however being in BA's Executive Club you can pay for the food & drinks with avios, which is very convenient. The only drawback I could find is a long queue to the bag check-in at Warsaw Airport - 3 opened check-in counters for approx. 200 people is rather not enough.",A321neo,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Warsaw to London,January 2020,1,5,5,4,1,5,yes
Mark Ellwood,United Kingdom,11th January 2020,No Trip Verified Status,"✅Trip Verified|  Rio De Janeiro to London Heathrow. Love this aircraft, only a 3 Class, Business, World Traveller Plus and Economy Class. 2 Cabins in Business class Front 3 rows and Rear 2 Rows. I had seat 3A, In my opinion the seat, Window seat with a bit more space than the usual seat (at 6'4'' a little extra helps) very private tucked behind second galley area, toilet is over the other side J/K. I settled in to sleep and did not have an evening meal. Crew very accommodating as they offered water bottles immediately. A good few hours sleep as normal and woke up about 10 minutes before breakfast. I really enjoyed the fruit, yoghurt, muesli and the full English Breakfast.

Pavlos Triantafyllidis,Greece,30th December 2019,Yes," London to Athens. The aircraft and the flight quality were good, but they don't provide free food and drink.

Neil Jeram,Australia,18th December 2019,Yes," New York to London. I was on the last flight out at 11.35 pm and this is clearly the cheaper version in all respects.  The Boeing 777 certainly showed its age. IFE screen was tiny, seat was well used. The flight time was quick (5.50 hours) and thats about it. FA is highly professional to the point of being unfriendly to me. The F& B was standard and not taken as I had eaten something earlier. I'm a One World Emerald and the cabin manager did not greet me. Its a small touch and in the grand scheme of things means little but is an acknowledgement that you spend time and money with that carrier (usually followed by a drink or two).",Boeing 777 - 200,Business,Economy Class,New York to London,December 2019,1,2,1,5,1,5,no
David Ellis,United Kingdom,8th December 2019,Yes," Johannesburg to London. The recently refurbished First and Club World lounge at JNB has failed to resolve the congestion when passengers from the two evening flights to LHR descend on it. There's more table space for eating and the food has improved, but poor acoustics mean intrusion on privacy. Crying babies and facetime calls add to the restless maelstrom of human activity. Boarding was reasonably quick although there was the usual confusion about group queues. The predominantly young, mixed fleet crew were competent but lacked finesse and kept on getting drinks orders muddled. The meal service took ages because of some unidentified problem with heating the main course. The food itself wasn't at all bad - when it was finally served. The cabin temperature wasn't too hot and we both slept quite well. Arrival was ten minutes ahead of schedule and baggage collection was quick. Overall, a good flight despite the aged Club World product.",A380,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Johannesburg to London,December 2019,1,3,3,3,1,4,yes
R Garejal,India,25th November 2019,Yes, London to Bangalore. The flight from Bangalore to London on 10 November 2019 was delayed by 4 hours that resulted in me missing the connection flight.

J Cohlen,Ireland,16th November 2019,Yes," London to Vancouver. I used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively. I flew on the 14th and it was a remarkably bad experience. Food service was very poor in most aspects. I had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes. No drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing. Rather, tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed. I had to ask twice for a beer before it was delivered.This then put me out of sync with the service. The one time (yes one time!) offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely. Service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality. On a 9hr flight engagement is pretty critical! Our hostess/host seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else. The cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing. The entertainment system is a joke as it is so old. I had become so accustomed to a normal/newish TV screen that I was blown away that this system was still in place. The screen size was the equivalent of your phone’s. No music selection worth talking about so I just used my iPad. On this or similar routes I have flown Air Canada, WestJet, Virgin Atlantic, Air Transat. BA was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only. I cannot believe that the mighty BA offers such a terrible product in 2019.

M Keale,United Kingdom,2nd November 2019,Yes," Seychelles to London. Day time flight back to London. Staff were very welcoming greeted on entry to aircraft and shown to seats 7 J/K, Best seats as a couple to book as they are away from the toilet in the front cabin and the window K seat has direct access to the aisle. On-time departure and swift meal services, nothing was any trouble at all and the flight was full. Easy access to the club kitchen after meal service and great entertainment, I have found this flight great and love the inbound day time flight to London the easiest to travel on.

Jonathan Rodden,United Kingdom,27th October 2019,Yes,London to Belfast. Check in was fast and efficient and using the BA Terminal-5 First Class check in and security area was really good and I was straight into the lounge. Great selection of food and drinks early morning. I really like the BA boarding process i.e.by Group numbers. The onboard service and quality of breakfast served was excellent.

Cameron Sprincz,United States,19th October 2019,Yes," Edinburgh to London Heathrow. I have no problems with any of the flight crew or service while flying, everything on the plane was fine. After the flight landed, I rushed to the baggage claim because my wife and I had another flight out of London and only had an hour to make it. Even though we could see the plane and watch the baggage crew drive the bags over, it took 45 minutes before my bag came through. The baggage claim service desk turned away 30 other furious customers until a manager could arrive, by which time I was running to catch my next flight on a different airline, which I missed. Turns out the next flight home on our next airline wasn’t for another 6 days. Hoping that British Airways would help us in some way, we went to their horrendous customer service desk where an agent, basically told us to pound sand. It ended up costing my wife and I almost $3000 for new tickets to get home, spent the next 20 hours in the airport and British Airways refused to offer us as a meal voucher. We will never use this airline again.",A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Edinburgh to London Heathrow,October 2019,1,3,4,1,3,1,no
P Jacobs,United Kingdom,9th October 2019,Yes,"Dubai to London Heathrow. I flew on the A350 on one of its first trips and will be flying it again. On the same multi segment trip I tried SQ business class and EK business class (and sadly the old BA business class on an aging B777) on overnight trips. The new ""business suite"" offering from BA is the best business class I have experienced. I am a BA Gold card holder and the experience was outstanding. The First lounge at DXB was very good with plenty of seating and a good choice of drinks. Food choice in the lounge was limited but not an issue. On board the new suite was very comfortable and I had a great nights sleep with the closed door making all the difference to getting a full six hours in. The bed was very comfortable. Food choices were very limited (soup and sandwiches) although this did suit the timing of the flight. I would say this is an excellent very serious business product for night time business travellers. Whether it works for leisure travellers who want to wow rather than sleep or daytime travellers I don't know, but I certainly could work very effectively in my suite. Downside is the IFE is still rubbish in relation to the rest of the product.",A350,Business,Business Class,Dubai to London Heathrow,September 2019,1,5,5,5,4,4,yes
Dennis Le Quesne,United Kingdom,2nd October 2019,No,Not Verified|  One of the reasons we traveled club class was because BA have lounges where you can get away from the usual airport chaos and screaming children. BA don’t tell you there is no lounge at Kos airport. Limited seating. Very noisy limited facilities. Not sure I will spend so much on air tickets with them in the future if they don’t warn of limited facilities. It doesn’t help that the flight is delayed by an hour!,A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Kos to Gatwick,October 2019,1,3,2,1,2,3,no
M Irving,United Kingdom,21st September 2019,Yes,"Having booked this flight a week before the BA strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before I flew and not in fact the day before, I was apprehensive as to how it would operate. The check-in and security clearance at T5 took only 15 minutes. Personally I do not like the self service bag and tag drop that BA operate as one is not 100% confident that I did everything correctly. Boarding is by the new fare group system (1 to 5) which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket. Again I'm not a fan of this. Possibly due to the previous day's strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights, the aircraft was a large A321. Boarding was however smooth. On board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the EuroTraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room (I'm 1m.79cm and my knees do not touch the seat in front). The departure was only 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time. In flight there were 3 cabin staff in the Euro Traveller cabin (believe 2 in Club cabin) who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight. Again it is a shame though that BA have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline. The landing at Tegel was 30 minutes ahead of schedule. All in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking. Tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait for luggage but this was not BA's fault.",A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Berlin Tegel,September 2019,1,5,3,3,1,5,yes
Alex Blackstock,United Kingdom,13th September 2019,Yes, London to Bangkok. What an awful plane. Seats are just about OK going. Coming back it seemed like a bar going across the bottom back part of the seat. Really uncomfortable. The meals are fine but alas the last meal is served just over an hour before landing and rushed. The main problem is the entertainment on a small scratched screen and about 15 films. Rubbish. Took 2 hours to get the screens to actually work. The plane looks old and tired. Not a pleasure to travel on this plane.,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Bangkok,September 2019,1,3,4,4,3,3,no
J. Knopf,United States,4th September 2019,No,"Not Verified|  London to Johannesburg. British Airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel. But in addition, if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight, you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments. With that said in 2018, my wife and I made reservations on BA to fly to Johannesburg from London for an African adventure this October, specifically 10/31. Yes, that's the day called for Brexit. Only we made our reservations before those dates were set. Considering BA pilots have called for three pilot strikes on September 2019, coupled with Brexit, we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection. The good news is close to $800 in fees for our two Business Class tickets was refunded when I changed our flights to another carrier through American Airlines Advantage. The bad news is the $220.00 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded. I called BA to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses. I was just not feeling the love here! So I am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly British Airways. All of the other outstanding carriers don't charge nearly the high fees and most don't charge for reserving your seats in advance. Instead of BA, we changed our booking to 10/30 on Etihad Airways through Abu Dhabi. Their customer service was outstanding. The fees were lower and yes, no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and I can travel next to each other. I am entering travel in September 2019, because there was no other option for future travel. This request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight. This is an airline policy review and lets the buyer beware.",A380,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Johannesburg,September 2019,1,1,2,1,3,1,no
Andrew Miao,Hong Kong,23rd August 2019,Yes," Hong Kong to Copenhagen via London. The whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wife. My wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st August because our two pieces of luggage were left in Heathrow Airport by BA staff when we took the transit flight from the UK to Copenhagen. We went to Menzies in CPH and they filed a repor. We stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found, they should be sent to our air b&b house in Marstal in CPH on or before 3rd August or deliver to the hotel we stayed in CPH if they were found on 4th August. On 2nd August, we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the BA website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match. Therefore, we kept phoning and emailing Menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so. And the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport, which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset. The system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th August 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves! On 3rd August, Menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport. Unfortunately, when we went to the CPH airport on the 4th August, they told us that they had already sent the 'found' luggage to the island in Marstal on 4th. Apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date. They then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office. We did find the other one by ourselves in the airport, which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one! They were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the BA to push them to find the baggage for us. We believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up. We were so confused which bag was really missing. We finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in Marstal to the airport and send it to the UK address which was our next destination. When we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th, we phoned Menzies again and found out that our luggage in Marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th. Hence, we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th August before we flew to the UK. However, when we came to the airport again, we couldn't find our luggage and the staff didn't explain why and just told us to leave. If the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th, how come it would disappear on the 5th? The staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us. This service was totally unacceptable. We spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing! You can't imagine how furious and frustrated we were! We are literally sick of phoning Menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere. Now that Menzies staff asked us to pressure BA to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage. That's how ridiculous things have been for us. We are sure that you could do something about it.

When i was rushing back to the security i met the 2 lovely ladies who had checked me in and they asked me to go up with them to the plane because it was about to leave, i panicked and they assured me that i will get my back pack in Durban. As i sat down in the plane another British airways hostess came and reassured me that i will get all my bags in Durban. On my arrival in Durban i got all my bags including my back pack!

Tony McLaughlin,United Kingdom,26th June 2019,Yes," BA 2616 and 2617 return trip from Gatwick to Cagliari. Both flights on a Saturday and were full. Aircraft was an A320-200 on both legs. Sat in row 7 outbound, 2 rows behind Club Europe. Sat in row 25 on the return, leg room seemed tighter than row 7. The brown leather seating suggested that the aircraft may have been in the BMI Fleet. Didn’t bother with the new M&S On Board service outward, but did on the return. The M&S sandwich was everything you would expect from an M&S sandwich (apart from the cost), but the coffee I had and the tea my wife had were below standard. It also took the 2 cabin crew the best part of 75 minutes to get from row 6 to row 25. The other 2 members of the cabin crew appeared to hide in Club Europe attending to just 10 passengers. Despite quite a lot of turbulence and the Seat Belt sign on for about 30 minutes, they continued to serve hot drinks and passengers were advised to be careful. You are now given a cup of hot water to add your coffee or tea bag to. Also a queue of 7 or 8 passengers requiring the toilet also formed behind the trolley, and they would not return to their seats. The rubbish from the trolley service was collected by hand as we were preparing to land. Outbound flight was fine, Inbound flight was not a great advertisement for BA.

C Malchier,United States,4th June 2019,Yes," My boyfriend and I wanted to return from our trip to London a day early but the BA app and website continued to glitch so I called to ask how much it would be to leave a day earlier. I was told that the penalty fee for changing the flight is $275 each and there’s a $50 fee for them to do it over the phone that’s $600, and the price of a flight by itself. We decided to try our luck again changing it on the app and paid $550 to change our flight to one day earlier to make it back for an event. The flight was delayed and arrived 1hr 55 mins late. We missed our event. The plane was filthy and my tv didn’t work. I asked the flight attendant for something to clean the slimy finger smears off the screen with and she told me it’s normal wear and tear but I could get toilet paper from the bathroom. I called to ask for a refund for the fees since the flight was delayed but they told me they can’t give us a refund because we got on the flight.",Boeing 747,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Tampa,May 2019,1,1,1,1,3,1,no
C Perton,United Kingdom,27th May 2019,Yes," Sofia to Belfast via London. The legroom on the Sofia to Heathrow flight was terrible. I am not tall, but my knees were pushing against the seat in front.  Service was non existent unless you want to pay inflated prices. Where did the service go? There was a bad delay on the Belfast flight.  We were not allowed to re-enter the lounge when the plane developed a fault, as we had gone through security.  Only after 40 minutes were we allowed to re-enter the lounge. Service announcement was chaotic and contradicted what BA was sending us via texts. The delay lasted 2 hours 55 minutes, just short enough to avoid compensation. The Belfast flight had a lot more legroom than the 3-hour flight from Sofia.  I will never set foot on this airline again.",A321,Business,Economy Class,Sofia to Belfast via London,May 2019,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
David Ellis,United Kingdom,18th May 2019,Yes," London to Cape Town in First and our first taste of the new 'soft' product. Still, unfortunately, a 30 year-old 747 that hadn't had its refurbishment and was showing its age. A wardrobe door that's falling off its hinges, a non-touch touch screen and a cupboard door in the washroom that won't stay shut don't pass muster in First and blemish the impression of the positive changes in the on-board service. The young mixed fleet crew did a reasonable job and served drinks and food efficiently without the wait other reviewers have complained about. Care was also taken in preparing and plating up the food. For once, nothing was overcooked and even the beef was decent. Bedding is also improved, with a good quality duvet and large pillow. The IFE remains the same low-res screen quality and the new headphones are uncomfortable worn for more than the duration of a single film. The goodies bag is much better and worth taking home. Overall, a pretty good flight, but it remains to be seen what BA will do with its long-in-the-tooth First Class when their new Club Suites are launched.",Boeing 747-400,Couple Leisure,First Class,London to Cape Town,May 2019,1,4,4,3,4,3,yes
P Merton,United Kingdom,4th May 2019,Yes," London to Shanghai. The most disappointing business class I have flown in a long time. The plane was old, worn and dirty (there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight), It took 2 hours to for drinks service to reach my seat after take off - the food followed shortly, which was over cooked. They seemed to be short on staff. However, what made me really angry was that there were people in the cabin who had had both drinks and food and were having their beds turned down before I’d even been offered a drink. The service was exceptionally poor. I am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flight. As a Gold card holder, you might have thought BA would check their frequent fliers are being looked after? I’ll return to using other airlines in the one world group for my long haul trips, such as Cathay, JAL or Finnair. The only reason that I’ve given more than one star is that I managed to sleep quite well - the bedding and pillows were good. Ultimately though - sorry BA, not good enough.",Boeing 777-200,Business,Business Class,London to Shanghai,April 2019,1,1,1,3,0,2,no
Dilip Kumar Vaikam,India,23rd April 2019,Yes, London Heathrow to Bengaluru. I found the crew very friendly and even humorous! Whenever the airhostesses passed through the aisle (I was on a seat next to the aisle) we would exchange some friendly comments which almost always lead to muffled laughs!  One air hostess admitted that she enjoyed such conversations which made the stress of her work lighter!,Boeing 777-200/300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Bengaluru,April 2019,1,5,4,5,0,5,yes
C Stainer,United Kingdom,13th April 2019,Yes, The booking process was easy enough but they have reduced the baggage allowance in terms of the seats one can book. The cost of including a bag added considerably to the cheapest fare. Check-in was well managed and it was good to see passengers with too much luggage required to check their bags in. Departure was well managed and although there was a delay the captain communicated well. My gripe is that my seat was dirty and the window was also dirty.  Some of the to buy M&S food items were not available and the lavatory I used was dirty. The staff were very professional and pleasant and the drop-down route map was nice especially for the younger passengers to enjoy. Hardworking crew.,Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Pisa,April 2019,1,4,2,3,0,3,yes
P Harris,United Kingdom,28th March 2019,Yes,"On the flight to Tokyo, I was separated from my wife even though it was our honeymoon. Thanks. The return felt like a 12 hour easyJet flight. One meal and one half meal. Limited drinks. Very small seats. I’m 5 foot 9 and my knees touched the seat in front. Very, very mediocre.",Boeing 747-400,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo to London,March 2019,1,3,1,3,0,2,no
R Morrison,United Kingdom,13th March 2019,Yes," San Francisco to London.

Sharon Baun,United Kingdom,3rd March 2019,No,"Not Verified|  Flew out of Heathrow on 22nd Feb to New York, 20 mins into our flight and we noticed our Tv's weren't working (4 travellers) but I have to say the cabin crew managed to reset them and they we were working within the hour. The reason for reviewing this is how wonderful the crew were. The crew on this flight were amazing, nothing was too much trouble. Thank you to all involved on that flight.",B747-400,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Heathrow to New York,February 2019,1,5,5,5,2,5,yes
S Willetts,South Korea,20th February 2019,Yes," London to Seoul. I normally fly business but this was a last minute flight and the cost of Club was prohibitive and so I thought I would give World Traveller Plus a go. The cabin is stylish and intimate and I was surprised how roomy and comfortable the seats were. The entertainment system was working well (although the adverts before every single showing are very annoying). I was happy with the headphones and small amenity kit and felt the staff were very welcoming. My only complaint was the slightly pointless menu we were given as for lunch neither of the meals listed were actually available. A similar thing happened with breakfast, three options, the third being the most appetizing, and no, it hadn't been loaded, so this is an area BA might want to look into. All in all the service was good and worth the price. For ground service BA, please at least keep a couple of desks for people to check into before automation puts us all out of work.",Boeing 787-9,Business,Premium Economy,London to Seoul,February 2019,1,4,3,2,3,4,yes
Michael Papalamprou,United Kingdom,12th February 2019,Yes," Flying premium economy on British Airways from New Orleans to London was an absolute pleasure. The nine hour flight was an amazing experience, with great legroom, reclining seat for a nice sleep and low noise.

Tim Janssen,Switzerland,1st February 2019,Yes," 
Berlin to Johannesburg via London. The short haul flight between Berlin and London was oKay, they don't include drinks or snacks anymore on short distance flights and prices onboard for them are compared to some low-cost carriers high. Because of an engine problem, the flights from LHR to JNB was delayed by 2:45h. British Airways gave £5 vouchers out to compensate for snacks and drinks. Inside the A380, the IFE boxes under the window seats take a big part of the available leg space.",A380 / A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Johannesburg via London,March 2018,1,3,2,4,1,4,yes
N Jalim,Switzerland,26th January 2019,Yes," Zurich to Heathrow. Last year they started boarding flights by groups.  A week or two after the free beverages and snack service disappeared, and the final nail in the coffin was pay to choose seating. I decided no BA anymore. I moved away from BA, the only issue I have that now I have to maintain frequent flyer status with two or three separate airlines. The last flight I took BA to use my Avios points and I literally flew free, but never to use BA again.",A321-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Zurich to Heathrow,January 2019,1,4,1,1,1,2,no
Gustavo Barbosa,United Kingdom,18th January 2019,Yes," Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale. Charging to choose seats, even within 24h prior take off, is outrageous. So if someone decides to carry only hand luggage one cannot choose a seat without paying extra charges?",777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale,December 2018,1,3,3,3,0,2,no
M Cheyle,South Africa,9th January 2019,Yes," London to Johannesburg. So impressed by the lady that checked us in. Something went wrong with my booking, I was supposed to fly at 18:10 (with my boyfriend) back home to South Africa after our visit in UK, but somehow my ticket was booked at 21:10. We didn’t even notice that until she had brought it up at the check-in. I was so shocked by the fact that I would be traveling all by myself (It’s my first trip overseas). She was so willing to help and she fixed it within a matter of 1 minute. We obviously thought that we would not be able to sit next to each other. With grateful hearts we were checking in our bags. When she gave us our boarding passes she mentioned that we have the best seats on the aircraft! How awesome is that! Thank you British Airways and their helpful staff.",A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Johannesburg,January 2019,1,5,5,5,1,5,yes
H Jones,United Kingdom,24th December 2018,Yes,"London to Kuala Lumpur. This is my first time flying with BA to Kuala Lumpur on the Dreamliner 787. Was very excited for this trip as BA has made a come back to fly to Malaysia after stopping the service for many years. I paid to seat at the first row to have a longer leg room. I absolutely regretted and disappointed for the choice. I made a complaint to the crew that my seat (30B) has sunk and I felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat for the next 13 hours. Crew only offered me an extra pillow to seat on it, which didn't help either. The tv screen on 30B was also not working and I didn't watch anything during the whole duration of the flight. I would recommend to totally avoid sitting on all row 30 as the seats are so close to the lavatories that you can hear toilets flusing at all time. This will be my last time flying with BA unless the aircraft is changed to perhaps the A380. I am dreading on my next return flight back to London. Crews were friendly and helpful. No fault with that.",Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Kuala Lumpur,December 2018,1,4,3,5,2,1,no
G Terigonis,Greece,13th December 2018,Yes," Antigua to Gatwick. One of the worst business class experience. Entertainment system didn't work and asked the crew for solution and their reply was sorry sir there is no solution. Service super slow 2-3 crew to serve 48 business class passengers. Food bad, beef over cooked, mashed potatoes dry and salad disgusting. Nobody from the crew to help us to prepare our bed. Woke up 20min before landing and offered a yogurt.",Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,Antigua to Gatwick,December 2018,1,1,1,3,3,2,no
P Downing,United Kingdom,3rd December 2018,No,"Not Verified|  Nassau to London. Premium Economy on BA is a joke. Highlighted by my Friday morning 7am breakfast. A glass of water and a breakfast box containing a cold, sealed in plastic, Croissant and an equally sealed Banana Bread/Cake. No hot food/drink; awful. That after a night battling with intermittent service on the seat back screen,  a screen no larger than in Economy. The only benefit for the money was early off the plane with luggage prioritised to the collection area. The extra leg room was about OK but the seat was simply uncomfortable for a 6/2 225lb male - yes large but not obese. BA Premium Economy - forget it. Other airlines do this better.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Nassau to London,November 2018,1,3,1,3,1,1,no
J Barvele,France,17th November 2018,Yes, London to Lyon. The flight has 1h 30 delay for a flight duration of 1:30. Ground staff forced me to check-in my suitcase during boarding process due to lack of space in the plane and I got my suitcase damaged with 2 big cuts on the back. Then the customer service has been very useless. Such a very bad experience. I do not recommend flying with them.,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Lyon,November 2018,1,1,4,1,1,1,no
T Smart,Australia,1st November 2018,Yes,"London to Bangkok. I am not a fan if the BA configuration in Business. However I did have seat 2J so it was right up front. I am not sure where to begin. Food awful, I ordered beef (a showcase of British beef the notes said) that was inedible I left most of it. Instead of asking was something wrong or would I like another meal option, the FA took the tray away and asked if I wanted dessert. Wine 2 reds 2 whites and 2 champagnes - hardly a stellar wine list. Entertainment small screen with dreadful resolution and a very limited ordinary range of options. Staff challenged at best, clearly some had not been in business before. Disengaged and disinterested. The cabin was over hill for me. The toilet was not checked very often, a sweet wrapper remained on the toilet floor the entire trip as did an overflowing rubbish bin. I would expect much better up the front of the plane we pay a premium to be there and the service and overall product do not match expectations.",Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Bangkok,October 2018,1,3,2,3,1,2,no
Bill Atkins,United Kingdom,22nd October 2018,Yes," Manchester to Philadelphia via London. MAN-LHR I am not tall so the Club Europe seating is fine for me on a short flight. Addressed by name - adequate breakfast of bacon roll, fruit and yoghurt. Concorde Room not crowded and no wait for showers. LHR-PHL on aged 747 but still my favorite - cabin/washrooms in very good shape though. I have no problem with the BA F layout unlike so many posters here. Excellent flight - experienced crew and though full cabin, all very smooth and professional. Beautifully prepared and presented lamb shank, good wines as always - nice to see a good British bubbly included. Only downside was deplaning in PHL where F passengers had to fight their way off through the J scrum - could have been controlled by crew, but was not.",A319 / Boeing 747-400,Solo Leisure,First Class,Manchester to Philadelphia via London,October 2018,1,5,4,5,1,5,yes
B Maltin,United Kingdom,1st October 2018,Yes," London to Bangkok. Flew British Airways for the first time in a couple of years. Terminal 5 is rubbish. It may look great, but you have to travel further using the train services to get there, and once there you may find that after check in you need to travel  again on another train  to  T5a or b as they are again separate  sections of terminal 5. I usually fly EVA and others from Terminal 2 and I would avoid T5 if possible from now on. The aircraft interior was old and dated, the seats had seen better days and the tv screen was about the size of an iPhone 8+ (without the technology). The food was ok at best, served cold to warm on both meals on both flights. The crew were okay on the flight home, however on the flight out they were not interested when you spoke to them. Landing cards for Thailand were loaded on the aircraft in a total of about 50 so most people in economy had to land in Bangkok and spend time filling one in just before immigration which is ridiculous as the queue is always huge at Bangkok and you want to just get on with clearing through and getting your bag. The flight had some drunks on the way back to the UK, and while this isn’t the airlines fault, I did notice that when one young guy of about 21 was told no more alcohol by the cabin manager (he kicked off) the next crew member did serve him. This is the last time by choice I will ever fly British Airways, if there’s no seats available anywhere else (which is why I went with them this time), then I guess I’ll have no choice.",Boeing 747-400,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Bangkok,March 2018,1,3,2,4,2,1,no
M Kamucheski,Germany,16th September 2018,Yes," Berlin to London. It was a connecting flight, so I should not complain. The flight was on time and the machine clean and? They do not serve free water, let alone tea or coffee. While this obviously costs nothing it testifies to the low perception of customers. BA simply turned into a low cost airline.",Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to London,September 2018,1,2,5,2,5,1,no
G Smith,United Kingdom,7th September 2018,No,"Not Verified|  Glasgow to Miami via London. Glasgow to Heathrow was painless as was transfer to t3. Heathrow to Miami on aging 747. Flight delayed by an hour due to temperatures on board being unsafe to board. Kept informed by gate team about progress.  TV screen tiny and poor choices of entertainment. Plane was looking it's age and a bit run down around the edges. Premium economy offering in cabin and seat comfort far superior on A380. What made this journey very good was the young lady looking after the premium economy cabin. Polite, efficient, welcoming and nothing was any bother for her. Service with a smile from start to finish . People in here quick to criticise poor service so big shout out to this crew member for doing a great job. Also meals and drink selection very good. Although leaving an hour late we arrived in time so overall job well done BA and looking forward to return journey.",Boeing 747,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Glasgow to Miami via London,August 2018,1,5,5,4,0,4,yes
S Andrews,United Kingdom,21st August 2018,Yes,"London to Athens. Since I started using BA in 2011, I can only say that the quality becomes worse. The leg room in Business Class in A320 is the same like in economy. The only thing that you get is an empty middle seat. The meal choices are poor: I had to choose between curry and fish pie. Also, they first brought us the starter and the dessert and after 5-10 mins (once we ate the starter), they took the starter plate and they gave us the main. The on board service, is less 'attentive' than some years ago (probably cabin crew are over-utilised and want to get some rest which is understandable). Also, due to the plane being late, the cabin was not cleaned properly. At some point we need to think why would someone choose BA over low cost airlines. Tickets are priced in a similar way, there is no food on board for the economy (while for business the portion and variety are a joke), leg space is small, there are always delays to depart from Heathrow (not BAs fault, but at the end of the day I experience delays). What is that makes BA in European flights distinct? Probably nothing.",A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Athens,August 2018,1,3,2,2,1,3,no
E Landen,United Kingdom,13th August 2018,Yes," Delivering outstanding customer service onboard.

B Robinson,United Kingdom,30th July 2018,Yes,"Flew London Gatwick to Tirana Rinas. Bag drop at Gatwick was basically seamless, and BA was offering to check in your hand baggage for free. The flight was at 8:10 and the gate was supposed to be shown at 7:24 am, which was oddly specific, but as we got closer to that time, that just got more and more delayed. Until we finally got our gate info at around 7:45. For which boarding had already started. Boarding was pretty much seamless. The cabin crew greeted all the passengers which was nice. The legroom was alright, perfectly fine for a 2 and and a half hour flight. Good recline aswell. I don’t understand why British Airways opted for buy on board, their free food offering before was perfectly fine. Although the food offering was just a few sandwiches which were quite expensive. And there was no real hot food options, just a few of their sandwiches could be served hot. Flights were on time. Flights cost around £320 return per person, which was quite pricey considering the cheapest option was around half the price. So overall, it’s a good option, but if you can find something cheaper, then go for it.",A320-200,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London Gatwick to Tirana Rinas,July 2018,1,4,3,5,3,3,yes
C Down,United Kingdom,22nd July 2018,Yes," Gatwick to Faro. Club check in at Gatwick is very quick and easy, and fastrack security is also very efficient and we were quickly through to the club lounge. The lounge itself is really nice, spacious enough to have plenty of seating available, and different types of seating, but it also feels very cosy and welcoming. The lounge was clean and tidy and there were pretty good food options available.. including some lovely scones with clotted cream and jam. As always the drinks offering in BA lounges was great. The new boarding by group seems to be working quite well and BA staff are finally enforcing the priority system.. long may it continue! On board was the usual club Europe offering.. which while not exactly luxury is standard for Europe now and for a 3 hour flight is fine. BA don’t ever seem to offer a welcome drink on short haul flights which was a shame as there is plenty of time after the initial boarding rush is complete, there was also no personal welcome or greeting of any kind.. it’s a quick and simple gesture that should be done on any decent carrier. I would also like to see menus handed out before take off, which could be done at the same time as a welcome. The food and drink offering on board is reasonable although food was typically over cooked and with sloppy presentation. Overall a decent enough flight and for a reasonable price, but a few small touches would make it feel much better.",A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Gatwick to Faro,July 2018,1,4,3,5,4,4,yes
R Johnson,United Kingdom,15th July 2018,Yes,Wonderful service on the flight from Edinburgh-Florence on 7 July 18.

David Moss,United Kingdom,5th July 2018,Yes, British Airways changed plane and consequently seating separating family in business class. No co-ordination at airport and apparently not one BA manager at Rome airport who I could speak to. Had to call BA customer service in UK which was a waste of time. Given bulkhead seats but upon boarding could not take seat as engineers trying to secure cabin divider in changed position. Failed to do this and left the plane with it unsecured as pilot did not want to miss take off slow. Advised stewardess but they did not care. Could not recline seat for fear of cabin divider falling and curtain was in front of seat. Waste of time paying to go business class with BA.  They did make us wear a seat belt upon take off so if the bulk head fell we could not get out of the way.,Boeing 747 / 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Rome to Gatwick,August 2017,1,1,1,1,5,1,no
B Pearce,United Kingdom,22nd June 2018,Yes,"We can not fault the new 'Club World' food and service, on the 747 outbound and 777 inbound it was great! The food was first class, the presentation very attractive, the quality very high - haven't had such tender beef on any airline before (or in a restaurant for that matter lately!) and the new style crockery/glass wear stylishly upmarket. It's worlds away from what it used to be, both crews were attentive, friendly and cheerful. Really liked the way the food came out on a trolley and you could pick and choose what you liked and mix and match if you wanted to. You now get a light day blanket, a padded blanket for night and a mattress protector type thing to put on the base of your seat, much better than the thin always static blanket you used to get. The pillow is larger and tons better than before. Can't believe how fast the time flew and how well we felt on landing both in Seattle and once home again. We do mainly Club Europe flights, shame as if this level of service and food is maintained the new Club World will be a great success.",Boeing 747 and Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow to Seattle,June 2018,1,5,5,5,1,3,yes
J Meares,United Kingdom,10th June 2018,Yes," Gatwick to San Jose. I’ve just stepped onto a BA flight from Gatwick to Costa Rica, an 11.5 hr flight, and can honestly I haven’t seen a screen with so few pixels since the 90s. I  fly other long haul flights and none of BA’s competitors are providing such low quality entertainment.

David Ellis,United Kingdom,2nd June 2018,Yes," London to Cape Town. Flying first class with British Airways is a hit-or-miss affair. But having secured a couple of return flights to Cape Town with Avios, our expectations were running high as we entrusted our car to the meet and greet parking. Unfortunately, Terminal 3 isn't the best starting point and Galleries First lacks glamour - or decent champagnes. The food on offer is adequate, although hardly first class. Hoping for better on board, we didn't use the sit down menu. Boarding was on time and according to BA's new group allocation. Our seats - 2K and 3K - were a first for us, as we've previously gone for pairs in the centre. But seats A and K are definitely superior, with more storage space and better privacy. However, there's no escaping the fact that the relatively recent first class refit is in a relatively ancient plane, particularly when one inspects the shabby state of fittings in the toilets and galley. The IFE is also showing its age and badly in need of an upgrade. But at least it didn't require rebooting on our flight. Cabin crew in first were the usual mixed bag. The FA looking after our side seemed to be in the wrong job. Food was better than usual, although a malfunctioning oven meant that we had to wait 30 minutes for our hot breakfast. Landing was ahead of schedule and we were through immigration and baggage reclaim within 15 minutes. Overall, a decent flight but let down by the attitude of the cabin crew and the age of the plane.",Boeing 747-400,Couple Leisure,First Class,London to Cape Town,May 2018,1,2,4,4,1,3,yes
Nicholas Robinson,United Kingdom,28th May 2018,Yes," I flew BA from Heraklion to Gatwick. I bought exit row seats for me and 3 others to sit together with extra leg room. I paid around £150 for that in January. We got to the airport 2 hours before departure, queued to check in and was told that 2 of the seats were reallocated to someone else. I asked why. The BA rep said it was because the plane for the flight had changed. She then said we should have got there earlier. She wouldn't call BA customer service when I showed her the email acknowledging 2 of us were given row 7 bulkhead seats with less room than normal pitch. I was told to email BA and ask them to refund me the seat cost. The flight manager on the plane told me there was no change of plane. She apologised and said she'd take our case up with BA customer service. I also sent in a complaint. Today is 17 days with no response and my money still not refunded. I'll never fly with them again.",Boeing 747 400,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Heraklion to Gatwick,May 2018,1,3,2,1,0,1,no
H Blumenthal,France,14th May 2018,Yes," London to Washington. Apart from the space, nothing nothing was First class, not even the comfort. Crew was hardly more attentive to service than in coach. Food which used to be fantastic is just eatable, no more. Wines which were the best in the sky when Jancis Robinson and Hugh Johnson made the selection (apart from a good white champagne, but mediocre rosé) are at the level of a business class. And my seat did not have sound from the audio/video system: so they moved me. And an hour later the whole system stopped without the crew apologizing. Needless to say no wifi! Apart from their LHR First and Concorde Room lounges at LHR which remain great, BA is now no better than a 3 star airline. Sad for the clients and shameful for BA management.",Boeing 747,Solo Leisure,First Class,London to Washington,May 2018,1,2,2,4,1,1,no
T Razim,United Kingdom,8th May 2018,Yes," Chicago to London Heathrow. I was dubious about flying BA especially after my last flight over a year ago - after which I left the aircraft feeling very hungry. However my trip to USA with BA was surprisingly very good both ways. On this flight, after deciding not to spend on an upgrade, I was pleasantly surprised by being given a seat with extra leg room - didn't feel the need to get up and stretch my legs once. Although I slept a lot of the way, the cabin crew were very helpful - even asking the captain to find the direction of Mecca so I could pray (in my seat). Was given two bags of pretzels and two cups of coffee - i had to ask for both, but was given without any fuss. A380 is a very nice aircraft and the take off and landing was excellent, although I noticed a funny (not that loud) motorised noise coming form the galley noise of the journey.

S Vincent,United Kingdom,26th April 2018,Yes,"Flew London to Budapest with British Airways. Massively overpriced compared to other companies on this route like Ryanair or Easyjet with no real added value. No drinks or food served on the flight, the check-in process is just as painful and most of the time they force you to ckeck in your hand baggage as well. A bit more legroom but that won’t justify the £200 price difference on a 2hr flight.",Boeing 777-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Budapest,April 2018,1,3,1,2,1,1,no
J Aberg,Sweden,14th April 2018,Yes,"Decided to go in Club Europe for this relatively short flight (90 minutes) from London to Copenhagen. Dropped my bags and went through security, which did not take too long. I then went to the Galleries Lounge (south), and although I have not been there for a year or two, it looked the same. Same food, same drinks, same slow wifi. My gate was just around the corner, and I got on the plane. I like the fresh look inside, but the seat pitch is ridiculous in business. The food service was disappointing. The service in the cabin was OK, but not very warm. I have travelled a lot with BA over the past 20 years, after yesterda I have lost my faith in British Airways.",A320,Business,Business Class,London to Copenhagen,April 2018,1,3,1,3,1,2,no
E Smyth,United Kingdom,5th April 2018,Yes,"Efficient check in helpful staff advised on best lounge option for our flight. Decided to opt for premium economy as only 4 hour flight from London Heathrow to Cairo. Galleries South lounge was relatively quiet good range of snacks including an afternoon tea offering which was quite good. Showers clean and well presented. Chaotic boarding. Well presented aircraft, staff in premium economy cabin offered welcome drink. Slightly delayed departure time made up en route. Unable to order main course for meal on line but got choice of meal which was totally acceptable. Efficient staff and good inflight entertainment. Happy with whole experience. I don’t think I would use over club world for a long flight but for a flight where you don’t need to sleep it was fine.",Boeing 787-9,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,London Heathrow to Cairo,April 2018,1,5,5,5,0,5,yes
E Christie,United Kingdom,30th March 2018,Yes,"London to Casablanca. Their customer service quality in Heathrow Terminal 3 is very patchy. For background, my initial flight was with TAP Portugal which got cancelled, then rebooked to BA. My second flight had further issue, and instead of requesting TAP to rebook me, BA took the liberty of rebooking a 3rd flight for me - which turned out to be overbooked. This then caused me having to liaise with both TAP and BA to rebook my 4th flight - I was tossed around by both customer care telling me it's not their problem. TAP can no longer rebook me on another flight as they have lost the right to alter the ticket as soon as BA rebooked me on the 3rd flight. I was initially served by a very helpful staff who attends to my rebooking issue - the last flight I was rebooked was overbooked. However, later on I was passed on to a couple of rude staff that were reluctant to serve me as it was 15 minutes past their end of shift. They were also talking about me in front of me and accused me of taking advantage of BA. This is very rude and extremely unprofessional. I've never had this treatment during my 10+ years of flying with various airlines, both top rated and low cost carrier.",Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Casablanca,March 2018,1,3,2,1,0,1,no
A Maltam,United Kingdom,19th March 2018,Yes," London to Beijing. Left from T5 at Heathrow, service is very speedy, you can use the fast track entrance which is swift. I didn't think much of the business lounge, food was more like canteen food, we were there around lunchtime, I ended up just having some salad and a packet of crisps, later around 3pm they brought out some sandwiches, this was preferable than the food that was on offer at lunchtime. There were many drinks available, wine was ok. I tried to plug in my tablet to charge it and none of the plugs seemed to be working, this was also disappointing. With regards to the service on board the flight, it was ok, however, they collected my breakfast card, but not my husbands, so he nearly missed out on breakfast, the next morning, they offered my husband a bread roll, but not me, it seemed there was not much structure to the service, which meant they missed things. The entertainment that was available was good.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Beijing,March 2018,1,2,3,3,1,3,yes
L Jones,Singapore,5th March 2018,Yes,"Singapore to Heathrow. I skipped my meal on board and have requested for the small bottle of water that was served with the meal. The air stewardess indicated that there were spare bottles behind and she will bring me a bottle afterwards which never came. When I asked another air steward for a bottle of water, he told me they don't have spare bottled water besides the one that came with the meal.

S Stevens,United Kingdom,21st February 2018,Yes,"The best thing about this flight from London Heathrow to Miami was it’s punctuality. However having got up at 5am for the flight time at 10.45, if we hadn’t eaten breakfast in the airport we would have been starving by the lunch service, which was served what seemed like a long time after take off. 6 hours after the mediocre lunch were were served an even more mediocre sandwich. Only one cabin staff for premium economy service meant drinks and meals were served very slowly by the hard worked lady. Aircraft an elderly 747 and showing its age. Screen tiny, scratched and hardly worth looking at. We have flown similar routes on Thomas Cook and TUI planes and the service and comfort of their new aircraft was miles ahead of this BA flight, which I think is shameful for the national carrier.",Boeing 747,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,London Heathrow to Miami,February 2018,1,3,2,3,1,2,no
F Meares,United Kingdom,10th February 2018,Yes, Orlando to Gatwick. The flight was OK but let down by utterly appalling food. The chicken curry was dry and congealed and devoid of any flavour. It was mainly just rice. The biggest insult was breakfast which was a pretzel filled with cream cheese and a very dry cereal bar - no fruit bits in it - just like eating sawdust. Who on earth though that a cream cheese pretzel was an acceptable breakfast? Bizarre and ridiculous. Looking around the cabin very few were eaten. I commented to the stewardess that it was not a breakfast dish and she replied that it did not look at all appetising. Come on guys - even a bread role and jam would be acceptable but cream cheese in a pretzel?

Derek Northcutt,United States,17th January 2018,Yes," London to Dusseldorf. My suitcase didn't arrive. I was unable to file a claim upon arrival because BA 940 was delayed and I had to catch a train to Osnabrück but was told I could file online. That is incorrect because the online system doesn't accept American Airlines strap tag numbers. I tried to call the number I was given but the agents in Madrid refused to take the claim over the telephone and advised me to file online and after I explained that this was impossible due to the faulty system they told me to call the DUS baggage office. I called the local number they gave me, but the call was routed every time back to Madrid who again refused to take the claim. Finally, on about my third attempt to reason with the agents I found a young lady who was helpful and took my claim. However, I did not still see my suitcase until four days later. Now I am trying with difficulty in just getting reïmbursed for my modest expenses incurred (toiletries, underwear, doctor's consultation, and replacement medication).

S Johnson,United Kingdom,9th January 2018,Yes,"Flew British Airways from London to Cape Town. Where to start! Yesterday 6th January our flight had been rescheduled from 18.30 for 11am today, due to technical problems which they couldn't fix that night. After a fair amount of announcements it was decided we would be put up at the Hilton hotel next door. So we all had to go back to immigration and then collect our luggage and schlep to the BA desk to collect our vouchers. We duly went along to the Hilton hotel and waited in line to eventually be told there were no more rooms available to the rest of us - by now it was 10pm so we were tired and feeling a little strained, especially those with small children. The desk staff told us they were trying to phone BA to ask what to do with the rest of us but were getting no answer from them. So at this stage my husband and I decided to come home and got a very expensive taxi back to London safe in the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 11am on the 7th January. We duly left home this morning at 8am to get here in time for our 11am flight only to be met with the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 18.30 tonight. Oh dear BA, why couldn't you let us all know this by sending an email with a phone number to drop into our inboxes sometime during the night? Just too efficient for you I guess. So we've been kindly issued with vouchers to cover breakfast which they didnt do, no problem BA we didn't mind forking out another £5 to cover it. You used to be such a wonderful airline, flying our country's colours proudly and we were proud of you, it's almost laughable at the errors you have committed to your paying customers.",Boeing 747-400,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Cape Town,March 2017,1,1,5,1,1,3,no
Z Gan,China,30th December 2017,Yes," Hong Kong to London before Christmas in First Class. Boarding was a little chaotic. There was no priority for First class passengers. Maybe the flight was fully booked. Cabin crew was very attentive and efficient. Service was excellent. BA does not have the best first class product, but their staff is the best in Europe. Food was tasteful and wine selection was superb. I had very good 9 hours sleep before landing punctually at LHR.

That was on the 10th December. I was there with a few thousends other passengers from BA, nobody gave us any food, any water and the most important any information as to what we should do with our transfers flight and suitcase. After waiting 2-3 hrs for my suitcase I was struggling with cold at terminal 4. Someon from BA took us to terminal 5. Today is 12th December and I am still in London without any information about my baggage and transfer flight to Budapest. I paid myself for a  hotel and taxi because all other hotels BA offered are fully booked. This is not what you normally expect from British national carrier airlines.

I paid 22 pounds to get exit for myself and my mom, however the staff in the counter keep question if my mom can speak English. Staff could not distinguish the Taiwan passport from the China passport and keep said that we need Visa to go to Spain. It took nearly 10 min for her to confirm with her manager and her attitude was really really bad. The worst staff I had  met.

David Ellis,United Kingdom,23rd November 2017,Yes," Cape Town to London. I can report a positive experience on our flight. From the moment we boarded, cabin crew were polite and efficient, and provided a high-class service throughout. Seats 4E/F suffer a bit from poor storage space and a lack of privacy, but they are the best for a couple. Glasses were kept topped-up even before take-off. The menu provided four choices of both starter and mains, and all the dishes were both well-presented and well-cooked. Talking to cabin crew, it seems that staff are now being trained to prepare and present food with greater care, and this really showed on the flight. The IFE screen was the usual low resolution with a limited selection of films. Still no WiFi, of course. Take-off and landing was on schedule, and announcements from the cockpit had that typical air of friendly professionalism. An excellent flight, overall.",Boeing 747-400,Couple Leisure,First Class,Cape Town to London,November 2017,1,5,5,4,1,4,yes
David Ellis,United Kingdom,17th November 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Flew British Airways from London Heathrow to Johannesburg. Plane at T5 Satellite C, so used B Galleries Lounge, which was quiet and pleasant. Efficient boarding, seats 50J/K on upper deck, which provided good privacy despite proximity to toilets. Mixed crew FAs and ours were young and enthusiastic. In-flight service good, with a notable improvement in the quality of food, i.e., courses delivered individually to seats and main courses not cooked to a crisp. IFE lagging behind that offered by competitors, with small screens and limited movies. Breakfast included four hot options which were more palatable than usual.

Derek Northcutt,United States,13th November 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Am continually disappointed by British Airways. It seems they are now in a race with Ryanair and easyJet to become the worst carrier in and out of the UK. Flew Düsseldorf to London. Their lounge at DUS is closed but their check-in staff doesn't know that (she sent me up there). I have a connexion at JFK and I showed her the boarding passes but she wouldn't interline my bag to their partner AA and I had to recheck it. Now, not only do they not serve a second meal on the 11-hour flight LHR-LAX, but now they want £2 for a can of coca cola that they pay 15p for. Usually, you should always fly across the ocean on a European carrier, but with BOAC I recommend Finnair or American with their One World alliance.

Paul Steensen,United Kingdom,4th November 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Singapore to London. My feedback seems to mirror many other users here - BA standards are just getting worse and worse, and I am talking about business class which I thought they would maintain? The cabin interior was worn and quite grubby, the seats terrible and now must be one of the poorest for long haul business class. The meal and presentation is really a joke, and on my previous long haul biz trip I got better food in Lufthansa premium economy. Cabin staff were quite friendly although they do hide in the galley a lot. Chatted to one of them who said so many customers are complaining and even deserting BA because of the fall in standards - I'm not surprised and I for one would not use them again for long haul. Time for senior management changes, as the present CEO clearly has no clue how to run what was once a premium airline. Now, they do little more than a low-cost and easyjet for one is far superior and nicer for short hops in Europe.",Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,Singapore to London,October 2017,1,3,1,2,1,1,no
W Neeley,United Kingdom,27th October 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Gatwick to Marrakech. Generally a well organised flight and fairly full in Y class. My gripe is about the current food service. This was a fairly long short-haul flight scheduled for 3h 45m in which a reasonable meal service would be welcome and desirable. After a lot of comments from others who have flown BA recently we bought food in the terminal before departure as the coho-ice on board is very limited, especially as much seems to be already 'sold out'. The biggest issue is about the time taken to do the food selling. It took almost all of the flight time for the crew to work through the plane to serve every row even though I observed that about 60% of passengers bought nothing. Of course this led to problems for those wishing to go to the toilets at the rear when food service starts at the front, any passengers from front to middle have no access to aft toilets after the trolley has passed. Passengers resorted to using the forward toilets passing through business class which I assume was not welcomed by those passengers. I overheard a crew member saying that they were not going to duty free sales as they were out of time. It is ridiculous that this paid and limited service takes so long. I remember the days when a British Midland crew could serve a full cooked breakfast with tea or coffee to all 100 or so pax on a LHR to Middlesbrough flight scheduled for 40 minutes or an Aer Lingus crew serving hot breakfast to all on a turbulent flight of 1 hr from Dublin to London. If BA want to differentiate themselves from low cost carriers then this is not the way to do it.",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Marrakech,October 2017,1,1,1,4,1,4,no
Anthony Geddes,Australia,21st October 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  London City to Edinburgh. Flight left on-time and arrived early. Impressed with the legroom on the Embraer 190 (much more comfortable than BA's A320s). Check-in, security and boarding all went smoothly and quickly. Cabin crew were efficient. Light snack and drink provided on this short flight.

K Lanson,United Kingdom,17th October 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  London to Abu Dhabi. I told BA at check-in that I would be interested in upgrading to Premium Economy if a window seat was available. The lady replied ""can I check - you are only interested in upgrading if there is a window"". I replied yes. After a series of phone calls, the upgrade was processed (I paid 149 GBP). My seat had no window or view at all as that seat is situated at the back of Premium Economy where the toilets should be. When I complained, I was told that seats could not be guaranteed so I had no complaint. No refund offered, no token gesture offered, nothing. The food was nice and the seat was very comfortable. If it wasn't for the rude customer service I would fly again. I was led to believe I could pay for a window seat and I paid in good faith. I've flown BA for years, but this year has been disappointing. I won't fly with them again.",A319,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,London to Abu Dhabi,August 2017,1,3,4,1,1,1,no
I Dorlan,Qatar,7th October 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Los Angeles to Doha via London. Great staff, poor food and stupid cabin layout. I’m spoilt flying gulf airlines, but this time I tried a rear facing “internal” 4 of 345 configuration. Firstly, staring in the face of my two new best friends (seats facing forward) was at best weird, and at worst like a business class speed dating experience. Crew could barely serve me, ventilation was restricted and access 100% blocked by the foot rests of forward facing passengers. Once the security screens went up I felt like I was in some sort of flying crypt and was tempted to assume brace position to give the impression I had died and was on a viewing. The food was embarrassing bad - bigger serves of economy style food in bigger economy style bowls. BA, you have great crew trying to do their best with silly cabin engineering and poor catering support.",A380,Business,Business Class,Los Angeles to Doha via London,October 2017,1,3,1,4,1,3,no
Douglas Day,United Kingdom,26th September 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Flew London Heathrow to Chicago. Simply appalling. Aircraft was old configuration B-747-400 with Premium Economy adjacent to First Class. Cabin was filthy, and carpets coming up. Food was inedible. The IFE system was old, slow, and low resolution. No wireless of course, either. British Airways senior executives should be forced to endure this awful service, and sample it themselves. For them to call it ""First Class"" is insulting, demeaning, and arrogant in the extreme. These old aircraft need to be replaced with the lovely A380, and the entire First Class and Club Class product should be reviewed / enhanced.

Departed on time, paid extra for legroom seat aisle side of exit door, don'0t bother as it has no pocket for documents, glasses etc.. Seat so narrow that you cannot move, seat cushion hard and old. Cabin crew comment, you have extra legroom arent you lucky ,my comment - yes and I paid for it when I asked about lack of pocket for my specs and passport. Food was bland. Arrived on time. Departing Abuja on return trip I had an aisle seat, again narrow and extremely uncomfortable. Old aircraft. Cost cutting squeeze in Economy will drive customers away as comparable airlines offer much more. Now the number and particularly the dimensions of the toilets have been reduced you can hardly fit into the toilet. Food on return trip was a so called breakfast, yellow mass called an omelette and some sort of potato fritter. Cabin crew went through the motions but seemed in a hurry to get service finished and to disappear. Return flight was on time.

Alan Wan,United Kingdom,9th September 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Flew British Airways from Belfast City to London Heathrow. First time I flew from Belfast and it's a great little airport. I had access to the BA lounge, which for such a small airport is pretty good. It was an evening flight and there were a decent choice of cold sandwiches including: chicken, smoked salmon, egg, etc. The bar was well stocked including Fever Tree tonic and Grey Goose vodka. Champagne was available on request. Due to a flight delay our plane did not depart from the air bridge, but at gate 6, but we could access this gate using stairs from the lounge, this was managed well as we were given priority boarding before general boarding was announced in the main terminal. The flight was probably at 30% capacity so the FA had no problems serving passengers. The flight was delayed by 30 minutes but we made some time and was at the gate at Heathrow 20 minutes late. This was a last minute booking for business and was pretty expensive at £343 return. But as a Gold member I got most of the business class benefits.",A319,Business,Economy Class,Belfast City to London Heathrow,September 2017,1,4,4,5,0,2,yes
A Wharton,United Kingdom,31st August 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Bucharest. A full flight both ways to Bucharest using a A321. Boarding in London was efficient and orderly. The boarding in Bucharest was more akin to a rugby scrum! Any sense of control by BA went out of the window. The plane was clean, but the interior was tired and the seating rough around the edges. There was no USB ports or entertainment which makes for a long 3 hours. The M&S meal service worked well flying out of London, but less so returning. Food Inventory must have been limited on departure as must products quickly sold out. Leaving a selection of drinks and crisps! Also the BA cabin crew are still learning how to take payments quickly and efficiently, which slows the process down too.",A321,Business,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Bucharest,August 2017,1,4,2,3,1,2,no
C Berlin,United States,22nd August 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  New York to Cape Town via London Heathrow. A huge disappointment. Even worse when you put it in context of what British Airways used to be. We decided to fly First  because I can't stand Club world (backward seats, forward facing seats almost on the aisle),  claustrophic, poor overhead storage on some planes. Seats were  narrow, poor seat controls (unable to independently control the different seat axes, foot rest had to be set manually), American Airlines and Cathay Pacific new business class products are far better than BA first class. AVOD great on one leg with the new Pansonic system, dreadful on the 2nd leg with the old system.  Food was mediocre at best. Breakfast JFK to LHR was passable, dinner LHR to CPT passible - wife's fish was okay my hamburger was inedible. Meal service slow. Cabin Crew from JFK was excellent, to Cape Town was passable.

Francois Koenig,South Africa,16th August 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Johannesburg to London Heathrow. Premium Economy very spacious with 38 inch seat pitch, very good IFE. The 2 crew serving this section were excellent: polite, engaging and fun. Amenity kits appreciated. Chicken curry was delicious- my brother and fellow traveller both advised their steaks were the best they had eaten on an airline. Impressed with warm bread rolls. Plenty of wine. Did not eat breakfast. Negatives being toilet and galley noise behind last row 38, elderly cabin, 8 abreast seating on Boeing 747 compared to 7 abreast on the A380. Outward from London to Johannesburg the upper-deck Premium Economy cabin on A380 is very personal and much more spacious and quieter than on Boeing 747 aircraft. Nice wide selection on IFE. Once again excellent, young and polite crew. Beef steak asparagus dinner and orange chocolate dessert was delicious. Negatives being inedible cold hard bun prior to landing in JNB, although hot breakfast was offered which I didn't partake in. Overall a very good experience and would recommend BA.",Boeing 747-400 / A380,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Johannesburg to London,August 2017,1,5,5,4,3,4,yes
M Robinson,Canada,3rd August 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Unimpressed! Service very indifferent, impression that it's only a job by flight crew with no smiles on this flight. Perfunctory service at best! Guess this maybe all you can expect when you fly economy. British Airways calls their economy 'World Traveller', I wonder if those 'at the top' making decisions have travelled the world and are aware of the (much) superior service (most) other airlines offer even in economy? BA take a page from Qantas to see what economy service looks like. My understanding is BA recently lost a star, and are now only 3 stars. Quite understandable from what was offered on this flight! Food, awful, dinner of chicken, rice and peas. Breakfast over Ireland was a cream filled bun and granola bars, awful! Even a recent United flight from SYD to SFO served better meals! No return of crew to offer more beverages. And no service of water during the flight which most airlines constantly offer. The wine offering was the best part, a reasonably good Spanish Pinot Gris! There are alternatives to the UK from Canada, Air Canada, Air Transat, Westjet. On Westjet, you purchase your food, but I'm sure it has to be superior to BA's offering! My last flight to Britain on Air Canada was much superior. Air France last October to Paris was excellent! Qantas to Australia, is always brilliant! The only redeeming factor on this flight was the Airbus 380, still the smoothest and quietest plane flying! Apparently British Airways CEO is an accountant and the 'bean counting' shows in the service and food quality offered! Service on my flight was budget airline service at best and should be an embarrassment to Britain's flag carrier!",A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to London Heathrow,August 2017,1,1,1,4,1,2,no
Steve Shaw,United Kingdom,28th July 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  The flight from Budapest to London was delayed by 22 hours, during which time British Airways offered nothing (no help with hotel reservations, despite limited hotel availability due to the World Swimming Championships, no food, no transport to and from the airport). In fact, BA doesn't even have a representative in Budapest, having outsourced it to a Hungarian agent (who did their best in the absence of any input from BA). Even the customer service desk I phoned was answered from India (also outsourced). When the flight finally took off, we could not even buy food on the plane. We were told that a BA representative would meet us at our Heathrow arrival gate to give us food vouchers, but he / she wisely didn't show up, because I, for one, was looking for a voucher for 24 hours of my life which I won't get back rather than some airport food vouchers. I have flown several times a month for the last 40 years with many airlines, and have never been treated as badly.

BA cut us no slack for the injury and the change cost a fortune. The good: flight crews were wonderfully supportive and helpful; food was surprisingly good; wheelchair attendants at LHR were wonderful. The bad: A321 business class was an economy seat with slightly increased pitch and the middle seat blocked; Boeing 777 business class seats were very comfortable, but a seat in the middle of the 4-seat central block allowed no access to the aisle if the aisle passenger had the seat flattened or was using the footrest; LHR connection of 2 hr was barely enough for terminal 3 to 5 transfer (BA representative said 1 hr would be adequate!) - even with a wheelchair that allowed priority through security and transfer bus. Also a nasty surprise: no wifi on a 7-hr transatlantic flight.",A321 / Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Barcelona to Boston via London,July 2017,1,5,4,3,1,1,no
R Sanyal,United States,16th July 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  A packed flight from Athens to London Heathrow. Cabin crew spent quite a bit of time selling food and drinks from a trolley. Everything had to be purchased. I had to go to the back for a glass of ""tap"" water - complimentary! Small TV screens hanging at intervals displayed the flight route. Minimal interaction with crew. Seat was fine. Bag space overhead was ample - no charge for that. Plane arrived on time which was a relief as I had to change terminals to catch a connection. I had two hours and made it. The travel was followed up by a customer survey by the airline. I was glad when the four hour flight ended - nothing special but at least it was on time and safely at that.",A320,Business,Economy Class,Athens to London Heathrow,July 2017,1,2,1,3,0,3,yes
K Sawyer,United Kingdom,8th July 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Gatwick to Mauritius. Very disappointed to see the decline in quality from BA since I last flew with them. For a flight of 11.5 hours to Mauritius, I was shocked by the quality of the economy class seats and that BA seriously consider them good enough for a long haul flight of this length. Possibly the least comfortable airline seat I've ever had, with every lump and bump imaginable, and the infuriating headrest which doesn't stay up, slipping down and banging you in the neck every 15 minutes. The seat back offered no protection from the person behind putting things in their seat pocket. Legroom also very poor (albeit I am above average height) but my knees were pressed against the seat in front even before they reclined into me. The food was also poor. No snacks offered, and the meals were slop. I have flown Air NZ, Virgin, Emirates and BA in the last two years and BA was the poorest in terms of food and comfort. Good points: the cabin crew were reasonably good, toilets were clean, and the in-flight entertainment worked fine with a good selection, but that wasn't enough to save this from being a genuinely poor experience.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Mauritius,June 2017,1,3,1,3,1,3,no
S Graham,United Kingdom,4th July 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  London to Dubrovnik. Interesting that BA have dropped the ""to fly to serve advert"" Boarding was the usual unorganised shambles. Selling hand luggage only tickets only adds to the scrum in trying to place a modest size bag in the overheads. No less than three couples came on with oversized bags. In one instance, it took 3 people to lift a bag into the overheads, coming dangerously close to dropping the bag onto to the heads of seated passangers. When complaints were made to cabin crew, the response was ""they are entitled to bring hand luggage"" The trolley sales of refreshments took an inordinate time. Most of the choices were unavailable. Cabin crew frequently gave the wrong orders, and had great difficulty with the automated card payment system.. Would strongly recommend taking own food on BA short haul flights.",Boeing 747-400,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Dubrovnik,June 2017,1,1,1,1,0,1,no
R Jarvis,United Kingdom,29th June 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  On the 13th June 2017 I travelled from Mykonos to London Heathrow on BA 651. If British airways are trying to compete with budget airlines they are failing dismally. We were two hours into a four hour flight before the refreshment trolley reached us only to be informed that there were no sandwiches left for us to purchase. All we were offered was a packet of peanuts or a packet of two biscuits. This flight left around lunchtime and I would have thought it would be obvious there would be a large demand for something to eat. To add to the problems of no refreshment being available there was only one card machine in operation. If there is going to be a no cash policy then make sure your staff have the tools to work with. I have today received a telephone call from BA following my initial complaint which really served no purpose. It was a case of sorry but we are working to improve the service which doesn't help me. A service which was very good before the cost cutting.  'We fly to serve' I somehow don't think so anymore. Easy jet, Ryanair and other budget airlines must be clapping their hands with joy as they will benefit from this shambles. I cannot imagine flying with BA again.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mykonos to London,June 2017,1,1,1,3,0,1,no
T Donovan,Laos,23rd June 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Bangkok to Luxembourg via London. Premium economy on British Airways is disappointing. The Bangkok to London route is served by B777 aircraft that look like they've seen better days. Boarding was chaotic on both outward and return flights. Seats are old and worn, not very wide, and with little recline. The IFE is poor in terms of choice, the screens are the smallest I've ever seen, and the sound quality is very bad. The food served is ok. Service on board during the outward leg was perfunctory but excellent on the return leg, with the cabin attendant who served me being a real credit and asset to the airline. The short haul flights between London and Luxembourg (in economy) were good. It's time for British Airways to pull up its socks if it wants to compete with the leading Asian, Middle Eastern airlines, or even the better European ones.",A319,Business,Premium Economy,Bangkok to Luxembourg via London,June 2017,1,3,3,1,1,3,no
Craig Cutts,United Kingdom,16th June 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Edinburgh return, possibly my last BA flights. I used economy (or maybe should be re named) economy minus outbound and returned in Club Europe, checked in online however 4 of the 5 checking in kiosks were not working at T5 so in the end collected the boarding pass from the desk. Security quick I'm a BA/Oneworld sapphire member so used the North lounge which was okay. Flight boarded on time but departed 15 min late and arrived 15 min late. A320, seat 11A an exit seat was fine however no service at all on board. Return check in quick as was security, the BA lounge in EDI has been the same for a few years now. It's at least quiet with nice staff and pleasant staff. Boarding through gate 20 on to a pretty old 767 departed 30 min late. Club Europe on domestic flights is a new introduction. Actually it replaced what was BA economy class. A cynical ploy by the BA board to extract more money out of its loyal customers? The aircraft was pretty full so some people like BA although I suspect many passengers were transferring at LHR. Service was okay food economy standard although included in the price. Arrival at T5 around 30 min late 10 min for bags. I fly between 20 & 30 times each year 90% on long haul flights. I have supported BA in the past although I've not used them long haul for about 17 months. Basically they are not good enough. Cut backs and poor service is evident. I expect security comfort and some service when paying £2500+ for a business class ticket. Qatar, Cathay and even SriLankan offer better service. On reflection I fly business class on most flights so I don't actually need any frequent flyer status. The cost of loyalty outweighs the benefits. I might fly BA in future as a very last resort or to use up the miles I've earned. But my loyalty will be my wallet in future.

R Drew,United Kingdom,12th June 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  London to Boston return in premium economy. Another very disappointing flight experience with BA. Overall a low cost experience at a premium price. Baggage drop in T5 is now self service unless you fly business or first, which feels like easyjet. Lounge was very busy and choice of food very limited.  The plane was a 23 year old B747, which seemed to be in its original or close to original configuration. The screen in the seat in front of my was the size of my iphone and the choice of movies was very limited. The cabin crew was friendly and did their best to operate in horrible conditions. Food was not edible, i tried the beef option but could not eat it. What i found truly shocking was the snack in morning of the return leg was nothing more than a muesli bar in premium economy. -Cost savings taken to ridiculous levels at BA. They have even managed to find a way to economise on the quality of the sleep mask supplied (no more cotton or other skin friendly material on the inside but awful full nylon / polyester material and only one instead of two straps on back). I am taking my business elsewhere and only use BA to spent the avios.",Boeing 747-400,Business,Premium Economy,London to Boston,June 2017,1,3,1,1,1,1,no
Kathleen Kirby,United Kingdom,8th June 2017,No,"✅Verified Review| We flew out of terminal 5 on Saturday with British Airways to Brussels, and found everyone to be very helpful and friendly, we even had a nice chat with a pilot as we went up in the lift to departures. We got the feeling that people were very anxious to put the disastrous previous days behind them. We used the lounges as we have a silver card, and they were busy, but well staffed, and the food was good. On the aircraft we took our own home made sandwiches since we really didn't fancy the Marks and Spencer prices. I bought a bottle of water close to our gate, and thought that was expensive enough, but the BA on board water was £1.80 per bottle. I did notice that the flight attendants were very good at giving out small glasses of free water. Like many, I can't get used to this budget airways approach, it's clearly embarrassing the staff who are very good. On our return, we had big delays due to the storms in southern England, and air traffic restrictions. Then, we had Brussels air traffic delay due to their system failure. At all times, the first officer kept us well informed and we got back to London and were parked on a good jetty so that we could rush to catch up. This delay was not BA s fault, and the cabin crew on both flights were friendly and efficient. I enjoyed the flight but hope that BA do not make any further cuts, and perhaps think about restoring free food and beverages again one day.",A19,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Brussels,June 2017,1,4,1,5,1,4,yes
Colin Boakes,United Kingdom,2nd June 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  I am shocked about how the First Class on board service has deteriorated with very evident cost cutting on what is supposed to be our national flag carrier. On our flight to Tokyo Narita from London Heathrow we were advised by the Cabin Crew soon after take off that the catering supplies loaded were 'limited'. To cut a long story short, this meant that my partner, who was the last to be served, was told what was available rather than asked what he would like. This is in spite of there being only 5 passengers in the 8 seat cabin. For breakfast prior to landing, we were informed that only two cooked breakfasts were available so it would be first come first served. The presentation of the food that was available was poor & certainly not worthy of the fine dining description BA uses for its First Class catering. We spoke to the Cabin Services Manager who was extremely apologetic & confirmed that there has been cost cutting - apparently at the behest of the new CEO who comes from low cost sister airline Vueling, with a resultant increase in unhappiness & complaints from passengers. The famous First Class Tasting Menu we enjoyed on previous flights is now gone & other cost cutting around on board service is very evident - even the rose in the First Class toilet was dead which really epitomises the lacklustre airline that BA has become. I fly regularly long haul with KLM & their new Business Class offering is now far superior to BA's First. How can our national airline, with whom we should be proud to fly, compete with other superior European & Gulf carriers when the emphasis seems to be only on never ending cost cutting that now affects even the most premium passengers? The Cabin Services Manager entered a formal complaint on our behalf from on board on 3 May. Almost a month later, although immediately acknowledged, BA have not responded, probably due to more administrative cost cutting. I should add that the ground service at Heathrow T5 & the Concorde Room were very good but as regards on board service, BA offends their premium passengers like this at their peril.",Boeing 787-9,Couple Leisure,First Class,London Heathrow to Tokyo Narita,May 2017,1,2,1,5,1,1,no
S Cartey,United Kingdom,29th May 2017,No,✅Verified Review|  Madeira to London. I was always of the belief that British Airways provided a better standard of economy class travel but I realise now that they are no better than budget airlines. In fact I have experienced far better service on EasyJet. We waited over 2 hours to be offered a drink and I ordered Marks & Spencer heated focaccia which had clearly been in the oven for 2 hours. On top of that there were just 2 toilets for 120 people while business class customers enjoyed 2 toilets between 20 of them. Of course we also had to queue behind the serving trolley to get to the toilet so you can imagine how long that took! They make it very clear that 'economy' class is just that but its shame the price doesn't match the standard of service. All in all a very disappointing experience and I will certainly think twice about choosing BA in future.,Boeing 787-9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Madeira to Gatwick,May 2017,1,2,1,3,1,2,no

I have tried now for a week to book flights online and via their call centre to book and upgrade. Whilst the site shows availability it then croaks to a halt with an error, it has been 7 days of this. I have contacted BA through their twitter account to be told to call their Bahrain call centre, which of course does not work but have been told to call the Indian centre. 4 times I have called at my own expense to get people with poor English, have no idea how to manage the upgrade, quote outrageous prices 4 times the web price.

S Dawkins,United Kingdom,24th April 2017,No,"✅Verified Review| Singapore to London Heathrow - after reading the negative reviews and the press about BA of late, I was not expecting much at all from this trip. Terminal 5 is a breeze and has to be one of the best things about flying with BA, we checked in and cleared security within 20 minutes. We secured seats on the upper deck of the A380, which seemed more intimate than if we were on the lower deck. Seats were comfortable for the journey and entertainment fine. BA cabin crew seemed rushed throughout the journey, lead purser was busy talking when guests were entering the aircraft, no hello from her or acknowledgement. Once we got to our seats, there was no space left in the overhead lockers, no help from cabin crew but didn't expect any either, they just looked on and told us where not to store our bags. Food was kept to the bare minimum for this 13.5 hour journey with 2 hot meals provided at dinner and breakfast, nothing in between. I was actually surprised to receive the second hot meal for breakfast. We got more food and snacks on our Qantas flight from Singapore to Australia, which was much shorter at 7 hours. I still cannot understand how BA are considered a 4 star airline! Qantas also a 4 star airline was much better! In all I was not disappointed with BA, as I prepared myself for the worst. I would only fly them again if I can score cheap seats.",A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to London Heathrow,April 2017,1,3,2,4,1,3,no
B Parkes,Germany,21st April 2017,No,"✅Verified Review| Stuttgart to London with British Airways. How things have changed. Passengers now queue at gate as with easyJet or Ryanair, rather than sitting and waiting to be called. Unsurprisingly, boarding in Stuttgart by agency staff was chaotic - unsure who was entitled to what. Cabin crew increasingly young and inexperienced, probably because older members have left in view of the transformation of British Airways to a budget airline. How visible this was! Few people bothered to purchase the over-priced snacks and drinks on offer. Once that was out of the way, the three cabin crew members gathered in the rear galley, chatted, and munched away at the spare food from the Business Class section which had been surreptitiously taken to the rear. At the rear I noticed that one of the two lavatories for Economy Class has now been ripped out and replaced by two seats without window. Directly opposite the one remaining toilet those passengers looked particularly unhappy - not least because of the constant queues alongside them. Everything about British Airways now is shabby, telling passengers how little they are valued. And this does not even mention the extra costs for hold luggage and for seat reservations. My ticket theoretically gave me a choice of seat, but at the appointed time there were only four choices left. So, no, I won't be flying them again unless all other options fail.",A319,Business,Economy Class,Stuttgart to London,April 2017,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
David Taylor,United Kingdom,18th April 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Gatwick to Rome return. Outward flight the plane was full. Booked and paid for an aisle seat, but no legroom and narrow seat. Did not eat on the aircraft. Landed on time. Return flight left Rome late, again full. This time I booked and paid for aisle seat near emergency exit - more leg room. Food on the plane was from M&S. Chose the ploughmans option having looked at the glossy catalogue. The food bore little resemblance to the photograph - dry and not filled. I feel sorry for the cabin crew as it takes them ages to serve the food, receive payment (you can't use cash) and then clear it all up. Passengers near the rear of the aircraft would be lucky to be served. British Airways European flights are nothing more than a no-frills airline.

Kathleen Kirby,United Kingdom,9th April 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  We flew on a reward flight from London Heathrow to Brussels for a weekend and decided to treat ourselves to a full service experience.  We were very well looked after by superb flight attendants who had a great sense of humour. The lunch was chicken salad and a nice dessert. What we did notice is that the legroom was just the same as economy, and seemed rather worse than usual. The only perk we had was a blanked off seat in the middle, which, if you are a bit chunky like me, it was quite difficult to manoeuvre. This all tallies with what has been written in the newspapers, and we, like many other reviewers and frequent loyal flyers feel that BA is being turned into Vueling. If it weren't for the excellent pilots and flight attendants on BA who make our journeys feel very comfortable and safe, we would not travel on BA.

Richard Holt,United Kingdom,2nd April 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Flight from Gatwick to Grenada return with British Airways. Lounge in south terminal was good flight and staff were good, decent food and the plane was clean. What I struggled to get my head around is after paying for business class flights, BA then expect you to pay an additional £77 per person each way to reserve seats. There were 4 of us traveling so that adds in excess of £600 to our flight cost. BA will tell you that this is free 24 hours before departure but actually 3 days before departure most seats had gone. I would expect after paying for business class that you automatically get seated together but it appears not, as there was one couple on the return flight who had not reserved seats after paying for business class and were made to stand in the galley until everybody had boarded to if there were 2 seats together.",Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Business Class,Gatwick to Grenada,March 2017,1,5,4,5,1,1,no
Mike Palmer,Canada,24th March 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Toronto to Berlin via London on miles in a mix of classes. First class check in at Toronto was good with friendly staff. A fast priority security lane had me in the first lounge in 15 mins. Unfortunately first lounge was full (of gold card members) and so had to sit in the Biz lounge. Good menu to eat on the ground and decent selection of wine and beers. Fast boarding once it started and greeted at the door and taken to 2A. Excellent rose champagne served by friendly and professional crew. A weird but tasty starter of a cured / dried salmon followed by steak which was well cooked. Good cheeses and all courses selected were available. After some decent sleep, a fast breakfast served as late as possible ended a decent flight. T5 North lounge was packed with a 20 min wait for a shower which are now looking tatty and dirty. Decent breakfast selection of hot rolls, fruit, cereals etc. Quick board for the flight to Berlin. Ridiculous leg room -at 30 inches max. Very cramped. Don't like the table in the middle and several couples asked for them to be removed. An ok snack of cold meats though stingy portions. On time arrival and fast bags finished off a good and cramped outward leg. Returning to London in economy was possibly the worst short haul flight ever (including low cost airlines). A full A321 was cramped, insufficient bins (with one out of service) and the now infamous terrible leg room.(I understand this is to get even worse when BA moves to 180 pax on an A320 in line with charter and low cost carriers. Slow food and drink service with little take up. Some couldn't buy as no cash accepted. Not even juice, water and coffee offered for free. This penny pinching denying you even a glass of water makes the US and Canadian carriers look high class. The only saving grace were great crew who were embarrassed by the product they had to deliver. The whole plane looked fed up, subdued and just waiting for the hell to finish. Final leg to Toronto on a 777 included a bus mystery tour to a remote stand. Nice crew who were efficient and offered decent service. Poor lunch of roast chicken, weird mash and overcooked greens. Not Biz class food and pretty average. (more like economy food). Afternoon tea was fine, with a fast deplaning and bags. On the long haul legs, the IFE was identical to Christmas, poor choice, little new material - clearly even the IFE is now down graded. The biz class product - once cutting edge is in urgent need of a revamp if only to get rid of the 8 across and lack of privacy. How the mighty have fallen! Experiencing four classes on four legs, showed the gulf in all classes between BA and competitors on both short and long haul. The short haul legs to / from Berlin are worse than budget airlines where at least you know what you're getting and it's reflected in the fare and extras. With less leg room, fewer toilets, reduced quality and/or no refreshments, and a general downgrading of service, the only thing not reduced is the price. This suggests that the BA Exec and IAG only care about the bottom line and not the customer or reputation of a once world class airline. The only thing left to strip customers of is the Exec Club and Avios. It's only a matter of time before this final nail in the BA coffin hits the customer at which point - I'm off!

The BGS Lounge which BA uses was a welcome surprise, owing to the fact that there are many Japanese food options at that time (JAL also shares the lounge). Business section almost the same as First, albeit more people. Boarding seamless. Here is where the ""value"" ends. Two meals for 11 hour flight, but if requesting snacks in between you are directed to a copy of Highlife where there is a ""sweet treat"" menu, with sugar family items priced around £2-3 each. I declined that, and stayed hungry. The meals served were carb-rich pasta (tasteless) and a rice meal (dry, tasteless). I have minimal needs, but I do know BA has cut back so much now that it really is drink + meal + drink + meal on trans-con flights. Crew were friendly enough.

British Airways was the worst airline I have ever flown with. Old shabby and dirty plane. Tv screen was broken and hanging off the back of seat when I arrived. The only nice crew member for the whole flight managed to move me. The seat I then sat in was dirty and had dirt on the seat back (old food stains) and on the belt. No drink served with meal (except water). When I eventually went up looking for a drink they had no beer at all and only had a little wine left. I had a white wine. When I asked for a second (yes only a second drink on a 9 hour flight I was told they had run out of wine also). I had to have orange juice. Awful and rude staff (with exception of one).

C Drew,United Kingdom,18th February 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Vancouver return.Both flights were punctual but sadly the 747-400 aircraft used are now beginning to look their 20 plus years of age, especially compared to the A380s BA have used on this route. The cabin is looking rather tired and worn and the seats are not comfortable enough for a 9 hour flight. I was very pleased to have booked an exit row seat for additional room. The IFE system is also quite dated and limited compared to modern offerings. On the plus side the cabin staff were friendly, helpful and courteous and this is somewhere BA seem to do well. Food and drink were complimentary and of decent quality for economy class. Boarding at YVR was very well organised, less so at the Heathrow end. It is also a shame that these flights depart from the cramped Terminal 3 at Heathrow. Overall a reasonable experience, but one that they could improve to excellent with a bit more polish.",Boeing 747-400,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Vancouver,February 2017,1,5,4,4,1,3,yes
N Smee,Australia,14th February 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Doha to London Heathrow. Having flown into Doha with Qatar Airways, the flight with British Airways was a shock. For a start the Club world seats are not comfortable. There is hardly anywhere to stow bits and pieces. The cabin crew were indifferent. We departed at approximately 9am. Immediately on reaching cruising altitude, we were informed that they were now serving ""lunch"". At 10am. We were told that we would be given sandwiches on descent, this on a 7 hour flight. A cynical person might think that the crew wanted to get meal service out of the way early. I don't know what timezone ""lunch"" was in, possibly Bangkok, but certainly not Doha or London time. After 5 hours I rang the bell. The female cabin crew person came and asked incredulously, ""did you ring the bell""? Yes, once, the entire flight. I asked for the sandwich and she told me that I would have to wait. No, I want it now. Not a five course meal, a sandwich. Having just flown on Qatar Airways where the entire menu is a la carte and you can order anything at any time, apparently a pre-prepared sandwich was a big ask. In business class. I was then pointedly ignored for the rest of the flight. I did complain immediately to BA and to their credit, I received a response - basically they were sorry I felt this way. Never again. Pay a fortune for this basic service.",Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,Doha to London Heathrow,February 2017,1,1,1,3,3,2,no
A Wong,China,7th February 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Hong Kong to London on an A380 in business class. I like the upper deck cabin and at my preferred seat, with complete privacy.

Mike Bailey,United Kingdom,3rd February 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Heathrow to Hong Kong in Business Class on 3rd January as part of a holiday to New Zealand, also involving flights with Cathay Pacific and Malaysia Airlines. The flight to Hong Kong with British Airways showed up all that is bad about British Airways now and how far it has fallen behind other airlines. The continual penny pinching and poor staff attitude was evident throughout the flight. Check-in at Terminal 5 was chaotic, there having been a ""computer glitch"" which greatly slowed the check-in and bag drop processes. There were too few BA staff on hand to assist and those that were in evidence were being continually harassed. Business check-in was better but still very busy. BA needs to speed up bag drop urgently. Other airports allow you to print your own baggage labels and take your baggage straight to be loaded onto the conveyor belt where a member of staff checks the weight to make sure it is not too heavy, not perfect for all passengers but would considerably speed up the process for the vast majority of passengers who can check in easily. The lounge was a disappointment with tired dirty furniture, used dishes not being cleared, too few seats for the number of passengers and very poor food availability. Not a great place to rest before an 11 hour journey and I would concur with other comments about the deteriorating standards. Compare this to the other ""home"" lounges of other carriers such as those at Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur. Took a shower whilst waiting and that was OK. The flight was not good at all. Cabin crew showed general lack of interest throughout the flight and seemed interested in just getting the meals served and then disappearing from view for the rest of the flight until it was time for the meal service prior to landing. Gone are all the small (and not so small) touches that made flying with BA a pleasure, such as hanging up coats, hot towels, a second round of drinks, a nice meal at a leisurely pace and an overall feeling of being well looked after. A comment about the seats, how can BA justify 8 across in Business Class? When the ying/yang seats were first introduced they were a revolution, but a lot of other airlines now only have 6 across with a lot more space and comfort and in most cases you don't have to climb over another person to get out whilst they are sleeping. I had a window seat and I felt very hemmed in. There was no storage space for the things you need during a flight, glasses, tablet computer, water bottle etc. All were kept on the floor or crammed down the side of the seat. Sadly BA is no longer my airline of choice. I spent many years doing international business travel and when you saw the Union Flag on the tailfin at some distant airport you knew you were already nearly home. I saved a considerable number of Avios points for my retirement which I am now using up, but on other airlines within the One World Alliance where possible and who offer a far better product and actually look after their passengers and make them feel wanted. Sorry BA but you've lost my loyalty. Club World is now very poor (and also Club Europe now) and you've lost the plot to the bean counters. Never thought I'd say this but I've joined the ABBA club, anybody but BA.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,LHR to HKG,January 2017,1,2,2,1,1,2,no
P Eden,United Kingdom,29th January 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  How the mighty have fallen, or should I say continue to fall. My partner and I booked tickets from London to Johannesburg back in September 16, we paid approx £1700 for the 2 economy tickets (slightly more than normal as we paid for extra leg room seats). It was an evening flight and we were traveling on the relatively new A380, our first problem was that our there was not enough room for our hand luggage near to our seats, so it was placed some 30 feet further down the aircraft - not life threatening, just annoying when you want to get things out of the bag, we were surprised about the lack of space. Our real issue was that when it came to serving our evening meal that the flight attendant announced ""here is your vegetable lasagne"" rather than explaining that for our £1700 they were not able to offer us the default evening meal (chicken or beef) as they had ran out of these! They made no effort to remedy the situation, whether there were other choices in premium or business we will never know, all I can say is that I am pretty easy to please when it comes to food but wasn't happy with a vegetable lasagne so I had no meal as a result. As I left the aircraft I received a text from BA asking for feedback on the flight, I took the time to respond  explaining all the above but received no response. Whilst I was in Johannesburg I tried to contact/ call Johannesburg to complain but trying to contact and speak to anyone at BA is like trying to get an audience with Pope Francis! I eventually received an email response stating that my complaint didn't qualify for any redress, I then challenged this, I explained that in a hypothetical situation whereas the passenger paid for their fare as they left the aircraft 1) would I have been prepared to pay the full cost of the flight (no!) and 2) would BA if they were reasonable, expect me to pay the full cost. In summary, I eventually was offered £15 credit off my next BA flight - totally unacceptable as I don't fly that often, even £15 shopping vouchers and an apology would have been sufficient, I felt hugely disappointed with our national carrier and it's onboard service and the same for it's customer relations which arrogantly doesn't give a damn. Looking back, the point that made me most angry was their total disinterest in me.",A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Johannesburg,September 2016,1,2,1,2,1,2,no

David Ellis,United Kingdom,19th January 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  London to Cape Town. Galleries lounge at T3 tatty and overcrowded. Takeoff delayed by an hour because of weather issues, but we were kept well informed while waiting for push back. Seats 62J/K on upper deck excellent for a couple, although the plane was looking its age, with patching up wherever you looked. IFE long past its due replacement date, with small screen and poor resolution. Cabin crew friendly enough. Meal the usual sub-standard BA fare, with diminishing portion sizes and overcooked mains. Hotel Chocolat chocs have now disappeared. Arrival at CPT only 30 mins behind schedule. Cape Town to London, the Galleries lounge at CPT spacious, but quickly became packed with pax from two flights. Food options dreadful, with the worst hot food we've encountered in any business class lounge. Cheese pre-packaged. MCC available but no champagne. Push back 15 mins ahead of schedule. Same seats on upper deck. Meal barely average and we avoided the hot option at breakfast. Arrived ahead of schedule. Overall, the flight itself was the usual BA service. Onboard was another matter, with seats and service way below BA's competitors and at inflated prices.",Boeing 747-400,Couple Leisure,Business Class,LHR to CPT,January 2017,1,3,3,4,1,3,no
Tony Lio,United Kingdom,15th January 2017,No,✅Verified Review|  Houston to London Heathrow in Business Class. The service from the cabin crew was less attentive and organised than the outbound flight. British Airways used a Boeing 777 plane rather than the 747 used on the outward journey. This meant there was no upper deck seating. The seats are comfortable and convert to flat beds. Both journeys provided a welcome drink and 3 course menu. I found I was still hungry after the meal so made use of the snacks available at the bar. I used the arrivals lounge at LHR which was great to have a shower and some breakfast.,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,IAH to LHR,January 2017,1,2,4,4,1,4,yes

Alexander Dangler,Sweden,2nd January 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Stockholm to Denver via London Heathrow. The Boeing 747-400 was very old and the inflight entertainment system had a small screen with very low resolution. The movies were quite limited. The seats were okay but compared to seats in new airplane they were quite dated. There was limited space for storage, both bags and stuff in the seat pocket. A blanket and a pillow was provided for transatlantic flight and the food was reasonably good. All and all not a bad experience - but compared to modern airlines it was a very dated experience. I flown several of airline transatlantic and this was by far the poorest experience given cabin features, entertainment, food and comfort.",Boeing 747-400,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,ARN to DEN via LHR,December 2016,1,4,2,1,1,2,no
P Greeson,United States,22nd December 2016,No,"✅Verified Review|  Baltimore Washington to London Heathrow. Bad start for my first trip on British Airways. Extra cost for decent seat, meant nothing. Bought a mid-cabin seat for my wife and I. Flight delayed 4.5 hours due to mechanical problem. So for the insult of paying for reasonable seats, my wife and I were rebooked in the very last row of the aircraft - no refund, just shoulder shrugs about it being a different aircraft. This caused us to miss our connecting flight to Venice, thereby incurring a 7 hour wait at Heathrow. Overall a loss of a half day. Thinking that BA would want to atone for royally jobbing us on the flights, was wasted. A couple of low cost vouchers for small meals were provided. A suggestion that access to the British Airways lounge would be a class way to assuage the delay was met with a look of astonishment. No real remorse, matter of fact responses like gee, this happens a lot and good luck. No customer loyalty sought. Dispassionate, professional, but not really friendly. Staff seemed tired and overworked at counters.",Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,BWI to LHR,December 2016,1,3,2,1,1,1,no
G Curtis,United Kingdom,15th December 2016,No,"✅Verified Review|  London to Edinburgh return. Check in at T5 quick was able to use the fast track and Galleries North lounge due to frequent flier status, quick security spent an hour in the lounge with good food on offer. Boarding onto a new looking A320 seat 2A with an empty seat next to me, departed 10 min late but otherwise a quick 1 hr flight staffed by a decent crew who served a snack and drink of choice. Landed about 10 minutes late but bags off quickly. Return check in again very quick but security pretty long, used the BA lounge at EDI which is quiet with a few food and drink options, boarded throu gate 11 seat 4F on a pretty old Boeing 767 which was full. Departed on time for a flight of 1hr 45min so landed about 20 min late, service okay again with a snack and drink offered. Okay experience I use BA domestically and in business clas around Europe because Heathrow is convenient to where I live and to sustain my Executive Club (Oneworld) status, however there are negatives in the fees and credit card booking fee that BA charge which I hate! Additionally I see they are trying to cut costs further by charging for food in economy on Domestic/European flights which puts them budget bracket. I covered 38 flights this year in all classes and while I will continue to use BA in UK/Europe. However this year I've realised there are far cheaper and far better options for long haul within the oneworld alliance.",A320 / Boeing 767,Business,Economy Class,LHR to EDI,December 2016,1,3,1,4,1,3,yes

Clive Drake,United Kingdom,7th December 2016,No Trip Verified Status,"Flight from LGW to St Lucia got off to a puzzling start at check in. No priority tags available and I had to ask for them. (I need not have bothered as the bags came off the plane last anyway). The BA 1st Class lounge was ""still closed"" pending refurbishment. (I do not think BA have any intention of re-opening the lounge at LGW.) The No ""1"" alternative is okay. Boarded and shown to seat. Noted floors had not been hoovered from the inbound flight. All scruffy. Flight took off on time to the minute. FAs throughout were fine - but no personal address by name. Seats look a little ""old"" - I suspect this plane was one of the first to have the ""new"" 1st Class. The IFE was certainly dated. Meal was ""sort of okay."" No ""Amuse Bouche"" anymore as BA want to cut further costs. Had to settle for some motley peanuts. They soon run out of the premium champagne - I suspect they only had two bottles on board. Crab appetizer was alright - nothing special. The usual butternut squash soup. This was my 5th 1st Class flight this year and my 5th identical soup. I suppose its too much to expect a nice clam chowder or lobster bisque from the bean counters at BA HQ. Main course of sole was dry and tasteless. Wines were fine and for once nicely chilled. Another disappointing experience from BA - but to be honest over time you get used to a ""business class"" product in BA 1st Class. I noted, when I selected my seats, that there was two unsold seats four days before the flight and a one way price was a staggering £4500. The flight was full - and if I paid £4500 for this - I would be in despair. I was asked recently why fly BA 1st Class at all. Its down to cubic meters of space. - and that's it. The alternative is BA's Business Class / Club World and that is an industry joke with the ying yang seats. Off to Perth in the Spring and flying First.

Therefore boarding took forever and with an excess of hand luggage, flight was then late. On board meal now a bag of crisps or biscuits but I know that by January even that will have gone, thereby relegating BA to a low cost airline.

Having not flown British Airways long haul for over fifteen years I was pleasantly surprised on my recent return trip to London. The premium economy seats on the upper deck were clean and comfortable and the food served was well above average.

C Bramill,United Kingdom,25th November 2016,No,"✅Verified Review|  Marrakech to London Gatwick with British Airways. Baggage allowance is a joke. Doesn't matter how much it weighs as long as bags are of a certain size but even this is not enforced or monitored by the airport staff. Apparently you are entitled to have one case and one piece of hand luggage to carry onto the plane. However, on boarding the plane there were people that had 3, or even 4 items of luggage which were far larger than ours. These items were crammed into the overhead compartments whilst other flyers had to remove their smaller bags and put them by their feet causing an even more cramped uncomfortable space to travel in. Other flyers had their duty free items smashed and broken. When we complained to the cabin crew they were in agreement and there was even a manager on the flight who witnessed this and gave us his business card to use as a reference when making our complaint the customers services team as he was also shocked by what was going on. When contacting customer services they were far from helpful even given the fact that there was an airports manager on the flight. Absolutely shocking behaviour from a so called reputable airline. We will certainly never be using BA again.",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,RAK to LGW,November 2016,1,5,2,1,2,1,no
Simon Crockford,United Kingdom,21st November 2016,No Trip Verified Status,"Flew from Miami to London. First time on the A380 and was a little surprised how unremarkable the experience was because you board via 2 jet ways the boarding was no longer than a 747 or 777. The World Traveller Plus area is on the upper deck and BA had divided the class areas into smaller spaces so losing the scale of the aircraft. The seat were comfortable and spacious even when the seat in front was fully reclined on the over night flight you still had space and room.

Nuno Luz,Portugal,14th November 2016,No,"✅Verified Review| London to Lisbon with British Airways. Very bad flight, when a person does not want to check in baggage it is because he packed to not waste time in the luggage pick up. My luggage was taken during the boarding procedure because they said the flight was full, yes it was but there was enough space to all to have the mini trolley that I had in the plane, and people that I must say had bigger luggage then my own. Once in the plane fast exit from Heathrow and once on flight a bag of chips, or peanuts, very healthy. On the arrival at Lisbon plane parked near the Military Aerodrome on Portela (Figo Maduro), and 10 minutes bus ride to the terminal and more 10 minutes to wait for luggage.

Negatives over and everything else was superb! The overall ambience isn't flash but rather understated elegance which you have to be British to fully understand I suppose.

Turned up at St Lucia to be told British Airways had overbooked and we had been downgraded : this is on a £1700 ticket. According to the duty manager, they regularly oversell the premium cabins and staff are fed up with apologising to angry passengers. We were given £300 each travel vouchers as compensation, so it means we have to use British Airways again. We ended up in World Traveller plus (premium economy).

I was booked on Air Canada but rebooked onto British Airways as I was unable to make the AC flight since AC cancelled an earlier flight from YYJ to YVR. Having flown British Airways in the past, I was looking forward to flying them again, but my trip was somewhat disappointing. Seat on the Boeing 747 not the most comfortable, but still a slightly bit better than on Air Canada's 10 across Boeing 777-300ER. Meal served after takeoff was chicken with rice - it was fairly tasteful. Cabin crew seemed approachable, but after the meal service, cabin crew disappeared and made very limited appearances during the 9.5 hr flight to London. I wanted a glass of water and had to push the call button - then waited over 15 minutes until a cabin crew walked by. Before landing, breakfast was served - consisting of a tasteless pretzel bun and granola bar.

Clive Drake,United Kingdom,24th October 2016,No,"✅Verified Review|  London Gatwick - Pisa Return. Another less than satisfactory experience with British Airways. I fly this route often as I have a home in Tuscany. When I first flew this route (as opposed to Ryanair) on arrival you had an air bridge which made it a more satisfactory experience. Now, as a cost cutting exercise - you don't. Which means if its raining you get wet. which we did. The BA LGW Club lounge is closed and we went to a temporary set up at the North terminal. It was fine. Very busy - but the light lunch was better than BA's own set up - the last time we used it. Plane left 40 minutes late as we were stuck on the apron waiting for a slot. I settled for a couple of G&Ts - and my wife had the afternoon tea which she said was fine. On the return the ""Club Europe"" lines at Pisa check in were used by just about anyone. It was a zoo. The BA airport crew didn't care and given the management at BA don't care about customer service and quality, why should they? Lunch was quite pleasant, some sort of Chicken dish. We got stacked for 15 minutes which is annoying. On both flights I got the front row which gave more legroom. The seats? Well the usual abysmal so called ""Club Europe."" A disaster and only worth the money if you buy them in a sale. FAs in both directions were splendid. They get very embarrassed about talking about BA cutbacks. Who wouldn't?

Sarah Shailes,United Kingdom,12th October 2016,No,"✅Verified Review| London Heathrow to Budapest with British Airways. Yet another abysmal flight with BA. The majority of passangers these days seem to be large tour groups. Perhaps that's why service standards and comfort resemble a 1970s charter flight. The cheaper no checked baggage tickets, allowing a ridiculous 23kg of hand luggage, cause chaos on boarding, with 2 or even 3 people needed to lift heavy luggage into the lockers. Consequently aisles are blocked and while these manoeuvres take place. All semblance of orderly boring has been abandoned, there is no welcome on board, only desparate shrieking from flight attendants to be seated quickly and to place anything small enough under the seat in front to accommodate said oversized hand luggage. The seats on my flight were hard and uncomfortable. Cabin so called service, was nonexistant. The packaged inedible offering passing as breakfast was thrust at passangers with no finesse, and accompanied by half a plastic cup of cold stewed tea. The cabin staff seemed hell bent on racing through ""meal"" service to maximise time available to chat in the galley. The one redeeming feature was that the flight left on time, and arrived 10 minutes early. I was only on the flight as part of a tour group.

Glenn Biffen,United Kingdom,5th October 2016,No Trip Verified Status,"I hadn't flown with BA for quite a number of years, so after seeing their new fleet, I was expecting something 'modern'. Instead, it was like being in a time warp. The aircraft had seen better days, in my opinion, and judging by the IFE equipment and the inner design, damaged lights and uncomfortable seats it showed. Our nearest toilet was out of action, not good. The crew were okay, the service was okay, it was just a convenient way of 'A to B' in my opinion, nothing else. Only until this airline manage to update everything they offer, utilise (aircraft wise) and provide as much emphasis on their everyday economy folk as they do on their frequent fliers, I may consider them again. Value for money is negligible, and after using other, forward thinking modern airlines, the experience made the end of a great holiday feel somewhat sour.",Boeing 747-400,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LAS to LHR,October 2016,1,2,2,4,1,1,no
Michael Shortland,Thailand,30th September 2016,No,"✅Verified Review|  Paris to Bangkok via London. What a mistake to choose BA for this business class flight. The experience of the seats (with their weird coffin-like configuration, sliding screens, and people climbing over me almost continually) was enough to say ""never again"". The service was very patchy, with some decidedly long-faced and size-challenged cabin staff. Coffee undrinkable, and forget having a choice. Main course near to inedible, but the portions were thankfully miniature. The wine selection was good, but my unsmiling stewardess told me there was no Bordeaux ""only merdock"". (I should have explained that Medoc is a Bordeaux region, but really). This simply comes nowhere close to Thai, Emirates or Cathay. Singapore Airlines is in a league way way ahead. I should add that the lounges in Paris and London were great. Paris was a share with Cathay, and London's Terminal 5 lounge was excellent.

E Ivers,New Zealand,27th September 2016,No,"✅Verified Review|  Bahrain to Boston via London. First time flying BA after flying Qatar, Emirates and Oman Air business class. Check in at BAH was quick and efficient with their seperate business and first class check in area. BA uses the Dilmun lounge, which is basic but adequate. The flight from BAH to LHR was on a 777. The seats are in a 2x4x2 configuration and are very narrow (similar to premium economy seats, and marginally larger than the economy seats) though reasonably comfortable. When fully flat there is not much room, and people over 6 feet will struggle. There was hardly any storage space, and the IFE screen was very small and of poor quality. The food was very average (I had the carrot and pumpkin soup). Cabin crew was disengaged and the plane felt old and tired. The lounge in Heathrow is large, but gets too busy to be able to sit comfortably. The bathrooms in both the main BA lounges are quite dated and need a good clean far more often then they get. The quality of food in the lounge is average, though the wine and spirit selection is decent. The flight from LHR to BOS was on a 747 and this was similar to the 777 - old and tired with cramped seating for business class. Cabin crew were a bit better on this leg, though still disengaged. The food was of average quality, though the wine list, while small, was good. Overall, BA has the feel of a budget carrier compared to some of its middle eastern counterparts. The lounge is sub par, particularly when compared to the Qatar lounge in Doha, or even the Qantas / One World lounge in LAX. The business class ticket was reasonably cheap, though I can now see why.

Pushback delayed due to late arrival of passengers who missed shuttle. 40 minute delay in departing due to aircraft movements volume that lead to two female passengers having argument that lead to CSD threatening to return aircraft to stand with one passenger being moved. Well dealt with by cabin staff. Very noisy group of males on golf holiday in seats to rear of row 21 who consumed alcohol the entire journey becoming very loud using foul language - spoken to by other passengers and told to desist. The food just gets worse each trip I fly with them - muesli high in sugars and cheese croissant tasting worse than cardboard - is this really the best they can do? Finally to round off flight, a very hard landing to conclude one of the worst short haul flights I have ever taken with BA .

P Barry,United Kingdom,18th September 2016,No,"✅Verified Review| We flew as a group of 4 from Heathrow to Krakow in Club Europe. The aircraft was clean and newish so had the new ""economy"" seats in the Club section. I would like to know who at British Airways sanctions the use of these tiny seats in Club (I know its nice to have the middle seat blocked but I would prefer a bigger seat to sit in - maybe BA should have a look at Turkish Airlines Biz cabin!) The service outbound was just adequate - one drinks round, then a dinner service (BA872) which was edible but slopping / dumping the meal out of a heated plastic container into a china dish in front of the passenger lacks some grace to say the least. Are the crew trained to do this or was it just bone idleness not to prepare the meal in the galley then serve to the passenger? In all, the outbound journey was just about passable but not comfortable given the seating. Now for the return - what a joke! Nn lounge at Krakow - that's right you squeeze onto the end of that overcrowed bench by the gate and keep quiet! The flight was delayed by nearly 3 hours, so by the time boarding started it was a scrum (priority boarding abandoned) to get through the gate as most passengers were so fed up. British Airways prefer not to pay for airbridge access to the plane so we were then treated to a nice ride in an old banger bus crammed to the gills with sweaty fed up passengers all trying to avoid other peoples armpits. Once on the plane the same tiny seats, although we were winners all round as we managed to bag 1A and 1C so at least we had some leg room. The meal service on this leg really did make me giggle. The steward offered a shriveled chicken salad (leg meat skewers), or get this, a boxed sandwich. I actually had to ask if that was it? He replied ""yes"" to which I replied ""so who's eaten all the food?"" He laughed and actually said we were lucky, and if I had any food with me could he have some! And I'm not making this up. Once at LHR it took 1h for the bags to turn up by which time the Pod service to the parking had stopped (and that turned into a complete drama but I won't go there on this ocassion). So - what did we get for our Club fare to Krakow? In my opinion very little, and what we did get was rubbish. If anyone is thinking of going to Krakow with BA my advice is save your money and fly economy (with another airline), and spend the saving having fun there. In fact choose another airline since BA on this route are just a joke. I have been Club Europe hundreds of times over the last 20 years and the gradual decline in the product has now just about reached the point where once I have used up my 300K Avios it'll be Bye Bye BA for good. (I will only use Avios to get First long haul as that gets you the best return on them.",A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,LHR to KRK,September 2016,1,2,1,1,0,1,no

New fast track security was quick. Number One lounge was busy but we had a reasonable choice of seats, refreshments OK. On boarding disappointed by the cleanliness of the cabin, when lowering the tray table from the seat in front on both my seat 4C and my wife 4A, they were very dirty, nothing that could not be solved by a wet cloth, but not good enough.

After two hours it was time for our gate number to appear, but it didn't. A mere 5 minutes before the flight was scheduled to depart, with still no information we where panicking as we didn't know the gate number and we thought we were going to miss the flight.

Two weeks before travel they decided to split our seats (without informing us). I found out when checking the Advanced passenger information that needed to be provided online. I obviously complained, explaining exactly what the trip was and how we had specifically paid extra to ensure we were seated together as recommended on their website. Their response was simply that they could not guarantee seats due to operational or safety reasons - but wouldn't tell me why they had chosen to change our seats two weeks before (only that it was an operational reason). The customer services representatives were unhelpful, refusing to look at moving any individual travellers, staff at the airport were rude and unhelpful. My wife is a nervous flyer as well, so the stress and anxiety actually really ruined our honeymoon with my wife being reduced to tears the day before we travelled.

The entertainment screen options were much more extensive than I've had before so I'm not sure if the different route made a difference or a different plane. The crew were kind and unobtrusive.

Boarded on time, Seat 1K, cabin very empty, about 6 people in First. BA First Service is fabulous, each passenger was welcomed and spoken to individually by the flight manager which I thought was a nice touch. The BA 747s are all in my experience quite tired looking. However I will be sad to see the back of them when the 777s arrive on this route in a couple of months. The First cabin looks nice but it doesn't feel like a First Class environment. The food was at best ordinary. The menu was not very inspiring, the main course was simply dreadful, dry chicken, the whole meal was not exciting as I would expect from a First Class dinner service. Very good wine / champagne selection. Inflight entertainment poor.

F Peters,United Kingdom,13th July 2016,No,"✅Verified Review|  Sadly British Airways Business Class, London Heathrow to Geneva is no longer worth any extra cost. I'm only 185cm and can't sit comfortably and relax without being sideways. In addition to Chamonix we have homes in London and Telluride, Colorado and BA lost us as customers for quite a few years on the LHR to DEN, 777 service, again because of the ridiculous seat forward/backward seat configuration in Business Class, that requires us or someone else to climb over us to get out of the seat during the flight. Therefore we flew Air NZ (much, much better flight if a little inconvenient) to LAX (6-8 return flights a year) and suffered longer on United to get to our destination as BA Business was so bad. Fortunately they now have a 747 on the LHR to DEN service where we can fly First Class which we are using, but it would only take another airline to do this route for us to move away from the ageing cabin staff and extremely average service.",A320,Business,Business Class,LHR to GVA,July 2016,1,2,1,1,1,1,no

I was in the airport from 7am till 9pm, that is for over 14 hours, and was told it was weather and out of their hands, even though they had over 10 flights to London over the period.

Staff were friendly but professional and the B777 was clean and in excellent condition. Couldn't ask for more. This was my return flight but the outward flight was just as good. Credit to British Airways - there was a woman near me who was terriifed of flying and one of the flight attendants sat with her through the landing. Poor woman was sick due to a bit of turbulence just before landing but the attendant dealt with it pefectly. I only booked a week before I flew and the price was very good.

Bill Atkins,United Kingdom,12th June 2016,No Trip Verified Status,"After my positive post of the outbound journey, the return from Philadelphia to London Heathrow reminded me how inconsistent British Airways has become. Before boarding was told just 5 F passengers, but actually the cabin was full, presumably upgrades, though supposedly no other cabin overbooked - this really does downgrade the experience for fare paying passengers. Good greeting, though CSD never did speak to passengers as far as I could see. Sleeper suits and amenity pack on seat before we boarded, rather than the usual personal offer to each passenger. Pre- departure warm champagne served and that was the last drink I was offered, other than a bottle of water, until breakfast. Did not eat as had been told that, since this is a Sleeper Service, I should eat on the ground. Very little crew presence in the cabin during the night, and I was awake for a good part of it.

T Long,United Kingdom,4th June 2016,No Trip Verified Status,"London to Bucharest with British Airways. The flight was slightly delayed. I wasn't impressed with the boarding process. It was a full flight and most of the passengers carried more than one piece of cabin luggage. It took some time for passengers to find space to store the luggage and this slowed down the process. This also had an impact on the speed of getting off the plane when we arrived in Bucharest. They should have been stricter with the cabin luggage allowance. As it was a more than 3 hour flight, they served a hot meal.

Carlo Mantovani,United Kingdom,27th May 2016,No Trip Verified Status,"Flew British Airways from Gatwick to Punta Cana. Where to begin? I'll start with the check in at Gatwick, having checked in online I was expecting a relatively simple baggage drop off, how wrong could I be. 4 desks servicing every flight, we arrived at the airport 4 hours before the scheduled departure time and spent 3 of these in the baggage drop off queue. Due to the slow service many passengers were getting called forward to jump the queue so as to not miss the flight. The staff on the desks looked thoroughly miserable and spent more time talking to each other than dealing with the customers. Security checks were surpsingly efficient but due to the time taken to drop off the bags we had no time to visit any shops and had to go straight to the gate, despite having arrived 4 hours early. Onboard the aircraft things improved a little, the food was good and the crew very attentive however the IFE is very dated on the Gatwick based 777s, my screen kept jumping every 3-4 seconds and stopped functioning completely an hour into the flight. The crew tried to reset the system but when it reset I no longer had the option to choose what to watch and could only watch the old style video loop. This wouldn't have been a problem for me if not for the fact that I paid an extra £38 on top of the ticket price to choose a seat.

Comfort on the A321 was very good, stylish leather seats with adjustable headrests. I had mixed feelings about the Boeing 747 to Sao Paulo. The headrests and recline were very good, however IFE was very outdated and limited, and because of the seat recline, hard to see the screen.

I had seat 11K and my wife 11J on our outbound flight. Seat configuration may be a bit odd but suited us for a day time flight and made conversation easy, although the window seat could be a bit claustrophobic with the partition up. Food and drinks were very good, we both had chosen the fillet steak for the main course and although cooked a bit longer than we would prefer was still moist and tasty. Wine and Champagne selection very good. Cabin crew were faultless, for example my wife asked for a Jasmine Tea and although this is not included in their selection the stewardess offered one of her one teabags! Only real disappointment was the IFE, the B777 aircraft are showing their age and the technology is dated, however the biggest problem is the video and audio selections which ae very inferior than many airlines.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,LGW to BGI,May 2016,1,5,4,4,1,4,yes

After a very nice first flight from Tampa to Chicago with my wife and our 15 months old baby, transit in Chicago was really smooth. Our stroller was delivered at the gate and with a stroller there was a special bus to transfer us to the other terminal. We did not have to pass security a second time, so we arrived very soon in a crowded business lounge. As a gold member I checked the First lounge, but ground staff did not welcome me because it was crowded too. We found a quiet ""dinner part"" of the business lounge, were seated by a very nice ground staff who offered me a glass of champagne to relax. Food was decent. Boarding the upper deck of this Boeing 747-400 was a pleasure with a CSD welcoming us by name. Flight was excellent: food amazing, enough cold drinks were offered, cabin crew looking after us and our baby. Our baby was playing all the time, singing and talking his own words. After this perfect flight, transit in LHR terminal was again relaxing. Stroller was again waiting for us at the gate, very nice. After security we went to the first lounge which was really was crowded, but we found a quiet place to sit. Time for a shower, breakfast and relax.

Food was very average and was served at 11.30 am as a ""lunch"" - bland and uninteresting. Cabin crew very quick and efficient but then ran away for most of the flight so that they could get the service over as quickly as possible. An hour before landing they reappeared again with cardboard boxes with a chicken sandwich, a drink and that was it.

The aircraft was very old and dated, and too hot with no airconditioning above the seat. Food was disgusting - some type of chicken mashed up with potato and peas. These 747 aircraft need to be updated or retired as they are now showing their age. Tv screens are so small and have no USB or power points. Outbound flight was with American Airlines that was so much better. New aircraft, good entertainment and food with was good. Now that you have to change terminals at LHR when connecting from Miami, there is no advange of flying BA. So if you can choose a different airline or if you have to fly BA, avoid the 747.

J Lawrence,South Africa,23rd March 2016,No,"✅Verified Review|  British Airways from Seattle to Johannesburg via London Heathrow. First leg SEA to LHR was on a 747. The plane was satisfactory to me. I don't understand the comments from people who think the 747 is tired or worn out. Not a bad ride in economy when the person in front of you doesn't recline their seat. I sat in one of the ""twosomes"" (seat 52A) in the tail. The food on this leg was bland, the continental breakfast was a disappointment. I would buy seat 52A again if I was traveling on a British Airways 747, but be advised there is no wall next to 52A that you can lean on to sleep. Second leg was on an A380. I sat in the tail of the upper deck in seat 82A. This time, the young woman in front of me reclined to the maximum as soon as she could and kept her seat that way the entire 11+ hours of the flight. The A380 is a very nice plane and the overall experience was pleasant despite extensive turbulence the majority of the way. The upper cabin on an A380 is amazingly quiet. The food on this leg was far better with an English breakfast served prior to landing in Jo-burg. I would not play for seat 82A again because there are two boxes under the seat in front of 82A that limit foot room, but I would play for seat 82B, which is an aisle seat. IFE on both legs was pretty sad but I'm not one for popular culture. Cabin attendants on both legs were polite and did a very nice job. BA ground personnel at Heathrow were very nice and helpful. I've traveled between South Africa and North America about a dozen times over the past two years. Flights that require you to change planes in the Middle east or Europe fly over Africa and so tend to be very bumpy even at night when most convective activity dies down.

Food main courses quite decent but the snacks inbetween and in the galley absolutely terrible. Seats feel very cramped on the A380 in economy class.

Departure about 45 minutes late but this time was made up with a 5hr 55 min trip. Cabin comfort and service pretty much the norm for British Airways Business Class : no storage around the seat and the IFE screen did not work as usual. Breakfast has improved slightly ; the fruit was varied and edible, croissants warm but the bacon and egg muffin was unfortunately cold.

Clive Drake,United Kingdom,2nd February 2016,No Trip Verified Status,"London to Singapore with British Airways, and the plane left 90 minutes late due to technical fault with one of their aging 747-400 that found itself minus two wheels stuck on the runway. First class was full. One would think BA would put themselves out on this route given the competition from Singapore Airlines. Wrong - the champagne was lukewarm (as is often the case). The amuse bouche taster was ghastly. Some sort of couscous and tasteless. Appetiser of sushi style salmon was very nice. Soup nice but lukewarm. Salad was forgotten by the miserable female FA. Mains of sea bass was very good. My wife had the same - but the beef main. She was very complimentary of the meal. White wine was luke warm. Solution - the miserable FA came back with a paper cup of ice cubes and dumped the lot in my glass. Brilliant. Wash bag of freebies was cheap and tacky. The seat - well I am very critical of this design. So much space is wasted with the ""island"" console in the middle. The designer of this seat should find another career. Seats already starting to show wear and tear. Why British Airways opted for a canvas material rather than leather is a mystery. In summary, the A380 is fabulous. Slept for about 5 hours. Great flight. FAs mostly were fine. Terrific landing by a very skilled pilot.

Onboard, the evening meal was fine, but the inflight entertainment choices are very poor. Films, TV and music choices are limited. Cabin crew were courteous and served one drink and then dinner - but no more service after that. Overnight no water was offered, we had to keep getting up to go and ask, and then only got small measures not bottles. Breakfast choice was fair but the food was awful! Luke warm gunge, cheap cereal, tepid tea - truly not worth bothering with. I believe this is usual as my brother had similar experience a month ago flying business class from Mexico.

Food was some kind of chicken curry with a salted chocolate caramel mousse plus a roll and cheese. Close to arrival they offered a cheese croissant plus additional drinks. Alcohol available for free until around Egypt. One serious cleaning issue under seat 34c where the side of the computer box looked like it had never been cleaned hence food detritus had built up.

E Thomson,United Kingdom,6th January 2016,No Trip Verified Status,"British Airways flight from London Heathrow to Glasgow. Shabby cabin, lacklustre cabin crew, flight deck crew whose announcements were mainly less than informative. A crew which appeared to be going through the motions with little enthusiasm and as little engagement with passengers as possible. Some time after the cabin crew had closed all of them, the overhead locker above my seat fell open before the plane even moved off stand at LHR. On descent into GLA it opened again and hung open for several minutes and I was tempted to unclip and close it. I made the passenger across the aisle aware in case the bags fell out on top of him. Eventually, the cabin crew member whose jump seat faced up that aisle got up and closed it. We should have been sitting upfront given our ticket class (part of a longer trip), but, after service issues with BA and a long journey prior to this flight, we couldn't be bothered pointing that out. Just another shabby experience to add to the other disappointments with regard to service and lounge provided by BA on a long return trip involving two other airlines, who were streets ahead in all ways.",Boeing 767,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to GLA,January 2016,1,3,2,2,0,1,no

Admittedly the Boeing 777 was showing its age and would benefit from some TLC! However the connections were on time, cabin crew were friendly, helpful and efficient. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the food on offer. Prior to the trip I was concerned about using BA again after 30 or more years of happily using other airlines. I was very happy with everything. If I'm picky about anything it would be that the strange yin-Yang seats in Club World were narrow at the shoulder for me, but once in the lie flat position I found the seat very comfortable.

I was very pleasantly surprised. Checkin involved no queueing and the same through priority security. Had access to the Cathay lounge and this was good. The pleasant surprise was the Club cabin. I have got used to the rather warn and used state of the Club World cabin in BA’s 777 and 747. This one appeared very clean and smart. The seats we find comfortable and enjoy the ying yang seating for couples travelling together. We found food to be very good for the two meals we were served. The final comment is that the staff appeared to be friendlier and more enthusiastic about their jobs. We found the staff on the flight home in Club were friendly and attentive. Overall,  a very enjoyable flight.

The first class section was dirty and cold, the Entertainment System broke down and had to be rebooted again and again. The service was good but food was nothing special.

The toilet at the front of the aircraft was so unbelievably small as to be difficult to use. We consider that the conditions we had to put up with were quite unsuitable for a four hour flight.

My flights have usually been on time, most aircraft do not have the new interior, a few with bmi screens at the door. I always order AVML meals which are good quality for dinner, but plain cheese, cucumber and tomoato sandwiches for afternoon tea. My issue is the inconsistency with the cabin crew who can vary from pleasant to rude and cut corners with the service when they can. I appreciate that the LGW base is a ""low cost"" base for BA, but there is no excuse for the crew to behave as they do. easyJet and Vueling crew look more professional and are more pleasant on the same route. The LGW lounge is tired and average at best. It needs a good clean. FCO still has no lounge after the fire in the summer nor have any other arrangements been made.

They will address you by name the moment you walk in, escort you to your seat and supply welcome drinks, towels, etc. Food is reasonable to good. If you don’t like (parts) of the meals, you can replace from (parts) of other sets, turning it in fact into semi- a-la-carte. Return flight was over-booked. By phone and email they contacted me and with my permission I was rebooked onto 1st class SQ flight at same day at more or less the same time.  In all, it was a very pleasant experience.

Very disappointed that I paid so much money for Premium Economy, and yet so little extra above economy class. Was in row 10 on both the outgoing and incoming (night) flights. Seats were not comfortable in that they were less roomy. I understand that because of the row, both the table and screen were in the arm rests, but by the time I had used a cardigan and the blanket to pad out the arm rests (very hard on the elbows) I felt very cramped. My immediate neighbour kept messing with his seat and was eventually moved as he said it would not recline. Later I tried mine (no one behind me) and, the same, it would not recline. Breakfast was a wholemeal croissant just out of the fridge - yuk. The British Airways check in staff at Newark are so surly and miserable. Whoever made the tanoy annoucements for boarding had an accent so that I could not distinguish what she was saying. On my outgoing trip and arrival at USA customs queue I realised that I did not have the customs entry form. Seems I should have been given one to complete by the BA check-in person. I had asked the flight attendants if there were any forms to be completed and they said they would check and get back to me. Never saw them again.

On a positive note the staff were working hard and water and juice was offered frequently on the day flight. The female staff on flight BA0010 looked as if the did not want to be there, very abrupt and surly looking. On the other hand the male staff on this flight were very professional, smiling and very attentive. British Airways need to work a bit harder and update the grubby fleet on this route as the Asian airlines offer a better product. Blankets shabby in business / premier elite.

Seats comfortable, very enjoyable flight. The return leg, Barcelona to LHR had the same meal so was very happy plus a glass of wine as it was lunchtime. The standby crew member (who happened to be a purser) in business class was chatty, friendly and pleasant to everyone. He did his best to make up for his colleagues major shortcomings! The original designated purser for the flight on the other hand was well .. he plonked the meal down in front of you without uttering one word. The only words he spoke to the entire 24 passengers in the club section were 'do you want it or not'. He put the roll basket in front of everyone's nose but still did not utter one word. It was bizarre - I've never on any airline experienced such rudeness and disdain for passengers whatever class they were flying! He couldn't even be polite to his colleague with just a 'pass me some cokes' and that was that.

One male cabin crew member was so overweight and sweating profusely, it was astounding that he could still be allowed to fly.

Problem is how inconsistent British Airways is in regard to baggage allowed in the cabin. Some people have two or three big bags when I thought only one was allowed. So this then puts pressure on passengers with just one to put in the lockers with the crew trying to get them to put the bag by their feet. Why should they? I carry less on the plane to be able to have foot space - why should I give that up when someone else brings on more bags. This needs to be looked at.

It is astonishing that for the money they charge, you have to step over the legs of the person on your outside, especially if you accidentally trip and land on top of them. Food was satisfactory although a small bacon roll for breakfast was again a poor show. AVOD was also satisfactory. Apart from the flat bed, this just really doesn't have a premium feel about it.

B Wijesinghe,United States,20th August 2015,No Trip Verified Status,"Was upgraded at the gate from Club World to First Class on a full flight. I am a loyal BA customer since 1996, and a Gold Tier member. Was welcomed and shown my seat, and the friendly young male flight attendant put my cabin bag in the overhead bin, before I did so. The suite has been modified a bit from the B777-236, but the seat remains the same, comfortable, but with a poorly-designed footrest. I opted for the Tasting Menu for lunch. It was quite good, but the food quality was not up to Cathay Pacific or Emirates First Class standards. High Tea was quite average, due to the dry sandwiches. The washrooms were clean but minimal, and the Club World washrooms on the Upper Deck of the A380 are much nicer. Pajamas and a wash bag were offered. AVOD was good. In-flight service by the same FA was very good, but the finesse of excellent First Class service was lacking a bit. Still he was always visible throughout the flight, and that was good.

Simon Bush,Ghana,18th August 2015,No Trip Verified Status,"I wish I could comment on the service on the aircraft, but with a 27 hour delay I am unable to and can only comment on the ground service after being informed the aircraft was delayed because of a technical fault. It is not the technical fault I am worried about but the way the problem was handled by BA's ground staff at Johannesburg's OR Tambo Airport. The cabin crew had arrived at 18.00hrs and boarded the plane which was due to depart at 19.20hrs to London. At 18.20hrs the announcement came that the flight was not boarding and passengers should wait to be escorted to the arrivals areas to collect baggage. The chaos then started. People close to the boarding desks sought to find out information and the possibility of alternative flights (which were fully booked). After about 40 minutes passengers were told to go to arrivals where BA staff would be there to assist. Got to arrivals, nobody was there to even tell passengers which carousel to go to. A series of late announcements then informed passengers to collect luggage and go to the arrivals area to seek hotel vouchers. Nobody was directing passengers at each stage. Passengers were congregating under an electronic sign that said South African Airways domestic transfers to collect vouchers. The line slinked back into the arrivals area. Only two service agents were dealing with all passengers. Chaotic scenes. No line for families or premium passengers. In the end no vouchers were given and free for all to just know which hotel to go to. No clear announcements given at any stage to passengers. All airlines have issues which mean a plane will be cancelled - it is how the issue is dealt with that shows professionalism and a basic duty of care to passengers. In this case there was nobody in charge, nobody undertaking line management and nobody providing one source of information. A true shambles. Passengers arrived at the hotel not knowing when the aircraft would leave (scheduled to leave 27 hrs after original departure) or what the real problem was (rumours only). Flying Club and having a BA Gold Card (with Gold List status) meant nothing.",A380,Business,Business Class,Johannesburg to London Heathrow,August 2015,1,1,1,1,5,1,no
R Gudavalli,United States,12th August 2015,No Trip Verified Status,Travelled on August 8th when there was a power outage at London Heathrow which resulted in missing baggage. The way BA handled is pathetic with no proper communication regarding status of bags. I called several times and had to go to the airport twice. There was much confusion with the BA people claiming 2 of the tags issued were not found in their system so no claim was made for these missing bags. No follow up though I was promised they will call me later that day on the 10th. Finally the bags arrived on the 11th but the whole experience left me not wanting to travel with BA again.,Boeing 747,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hyderabad to Phoenix via LHR,August 2015,1,3,3,1,1,1,no
T Farr,United Kingdom,9th August 2015,No Trip Verified Status,"Another excellent experience with BA. Very fast check in at Glasgow for Exec Club status holders (prioritised over a large queue) and the quickest security I've had at an airport. Though small, the BA lounge at Glasgow is smart, well designed and well stocked. Welcomed by friendly staff, good selection of sandwiches, cheeses, snacks and alcohol, and happily provided a glass of champagne on request. Loved the little whisky nook! Priority boarding was honoured and had row 1 seating on this former BMI A319. Good welcome by staff and adequate legroom. First Officer was informative and we took off ahead of schedule. For a 1 hour flight the crew provided a good service of snacks (crisps and biscuits) and a full bar excluding champagne (no CE service on domestic routes). Seats and toilets were clean and we landed ahead of schedule. My only gripe was that we taxied at an international gate and had to wait to be bussed to the domestic area, but this was only 10-15 minutes in total and staff were helpful throughout.

Michelle Bennett,Australia,6th August 2015,No Trip Verified Status,"From the lack of customer service both in their call centre and from their cabin crew through to not being seated next to my husband on a 24 hour flight, I am thoroughly disappointed with British Airways. My husband and I travelled on separate bookings and were flying back from London to Sydney together. I phoned British Airways 3 days before my flight from London to ask them to link our booking numbers so we would be seated on the flight together. I was informed they could link the numbers but not guarantee we would be seated next to each other. However if I wanted to buy my seat in advance then this would be guaranteed. I was not giving this money-grabbing airline another opportunity to take more money from me so I refused this option. My husband tweeted the airline and received two more replies stating they could not help with this. When online check in opened my husband and I were allocated seats 10 rows apart and could not change this. Phoning the call centre resulted in being told the check-in staff could assist. Arriving at Heathrow the check in staff informed us there was nothing they could do but ask at the gate. The staff at the gate told us they could do nothing and had already told another family they would not be seated together. The only person who offered any form of assistance was a wonderful staff member at Changi airport on the transfer desk when we stopped, who managed to seat me across the aisle from my husband from the Singapore-Sydney leg. This woman did not even work for British Airways but was the most helpful. Not one British Airways staff member apologised for this. The cabin crew on both flights clearly did not enjoy working in Economy. A request for alternative food was ignored repeatedly and staff were outright rude to passengers who asked for a landing card towards the end of the flight (I was told to go get it myself at the back of the plane). I will only be flying with Emirates or Singapore Airlines in the future who know how to look after their passengers.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Lisbon via LHR,August 2015,1,1,1,1,3,1,no
C Lindsay,United Kingdom,1st August 2015,No Trip Verified Status,"We flew Business Class to Vienna on the 28/7/15, Terminal 3 is a dismal place and the lounge reflected this. There was very poor food choices and everything was tired including the staff. The outward journey was okay, flight attendant was pleasant. I think the meal choices could be improved - these tickets are not cheap. However the return flight (31/7/15) which was in economy - also not cheap, was not good at all. The attitude of the staff was really below par. The food choice was an iced bun and a chicken/bacon bun. Seeing the choice I asked for the vegetarian option-Couscous with a few slices of pepper - all of which were tasteless.  When asked would I like a drink I replied - Bloody Mary. I should have known better, as this was the attendant who having to do a live safety demo chewed and smirked the whole way through, produced the drink without any WS. I asked if I could have some and then watched him add a good 1cm to the drink - turning the tomato juice a dark brown.

About 2 days ago I received a text message (not a call) saying that our flight had been cancelled - left us in the dark until I had to phone their 0844 number to get transferred to a Delhi call centre, when I was told I could get a full refund they tried to only refund me for the flights and not the seats on this now, non existant flight.

Inflight entertainment was good and updated to latest movies, documentaries, talk shows 5* for that. The seating space was just about good enough. Be careful of the head set it can get in the way and snap. The air conditioner was not up to the mark so it was warm in the cabin. The inflight food was extremely hot, in short it was burnt. The answer from the flight crew when someone asked for a second helping of 150ml coke can is that they needed to keep stock for the return flight.

The seats have so little legroom, it has the feeling of a budget airline (far from budget prices!) but OK for a short flight. The problem is this seat configuration is used throughout Europe and it's possible to be in such cramped conditions for a longer flight. Upgrading to business isn't a solution as there's no extra legroom on these planes. Have flown both Swiss and Norwegian in the past few weeks as well. Both had more legroom. Would recommend Norwegian (great airline - cheap, comfy, free wifi) but not Swiss (dreadful customer service). BA cabin staff continue to be very mixed : some attentive, polite and helpful.

John Duffus,Thailand,12th July 2015,No Trip Verified Status,"Having encouraged passengers to check-in online and save it staff time and money, what does BA do? It reduces the number of staff for bag drop to the barest minimum. Business class bag drop at 08:30 at Heathrow had mostly empty desks and a queue resulting in a quite unacceptable wait of more than 15 minutes. Then having raced through security, there was the almost inevitable flight delay, only this time the 40-minute delay to the incoming aircraft was a result, we were told, of someone forgetting to tow the plane on to the stand from another part of the airport! With flights taking off to the west, there was yet another 20 minutes delay during taxiing. Only crisps or a couple of sweet biscuits were offered along with drinks.

It's been on international and domestic roll aboard other than on a turboprop. My colleague had the same. Officious and uncalled for. Exactly the same cabin bags were rolled aboard 4 days later on the return flight. Seats were economy class and cramped with little recline and less pitch than economy on many airlines.

John Duffus,Thailand,3rd July 2015,No Trip Verified Status,"Returning from Chicago to Berlin, the overall flight experience was no better than the outward sectors a week earlier. I opted to skip dinner and instead have breakfast since the flight landed around 10:00. Breakfast was a hard slab of cake with one drink - a total disgrace! Once again the cabin was too warm and I saw no passengers using their blankets. The Berlin flight ex-LHR was delayed, initially due to the usual ""late incoming aircraft"" excuse, and then to a broken APU. So no air was being pumped in to the cabin and the engines could not be started! For some reason it then took half an hour to locate one that did actually work. Meanwhile on one of the hottest days of the year we waited on board in increasingly sauna-like conditions.

John Gray,United Kingdom,26th June 2015,No Trip Verified Status,"It appears BA continues to adopt a “do as little as possible” for this route, presumably due to their monopoly. The aircraft and cabin is looking tired/old, and decidedly mediocre compared to recent business class flights with Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways. Outward excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. My seat (2K) was shockingly filthy. It had been cleared since the last passenger, but I noticed much ingrained filth e.g. food /drink splatters on the cabin wall, crumbs in seat folds/gaps and stained cover, all sorts of debris on floor in gaps/cracks, and remarkably grimy carpet. Cabin attendant offered me choice of the empty seats, but on inspection these were in a similarly grim state. Seat was OK for comfort, but mediocre IFE choice with very poor quality screen. Meal service was good for food and drink, although dirty environment was off-putting. Lacto Veg’ meal much improved since last tried. Pantry service is underwhelming in places e.g. Mars Bars and KitKats are tragically promoted as retro, but some nice ice cream. Return in 1K, and excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. I'm ridiculously grateful that this cabin is clean. Tired, so skipped dinner. Decided to watch a short TV programme and found much better picture quality on screen compared to outward, although even less programme choice. I found seat comfort mediocre in bed mode, but got five hours of sleep. The cabin layout is clearly designed to maximise passenger numbers without much thought for their comfort. Awake for breakfast, so when attendants were offering bacon rolls I asked for my wife and my requested Lacto Veg Meals. Staff returned ashen faced, and profusely apologising, with two neatly wrapped and labelled plain white bread rolls. Such bad service, and a lack of joined-up thinking! You couldn’t make it up.

The lounge at Heathrow was very crowded. Afternoon Tea time so just sandwiches, cakes and soup available. Sandwiches were fresh and very nice. Plane as a 747 that had seen better times. The seat was clean but tired looking. The biggest let down was the screen that was blurry in comparison to the Bling Airways screen I had in economy. The main meal was really nice. Beef fillet that was tender and cooked. Side Salad full of flavour and Mediterranean starter that I wanted more of. The 2nd meal was ""afternoon tea"" of 3 finger sandwiches and a piece of chocolate rocky road. A real cream tea would have been better! Seat comfortable upright and in sleeping position. Got plenty of rest and sleep both ways. Coming back the lounge in Vancouver is above the gate. Just enough seats. Nice snacks. Another nice meal on board, spoilt by a dry bread roll. Breakfast was a big disappointment. Expecting a cooked English breakfast we got fruit in a plastic box followed by an egg and bacon muffin. I took one bight of the muffin and it mad me want to gag.

HER is infamous as a relic of the 70s and BA have done nothing to improve that. Check-in was interminable despite a Club Europe desk. There was a fast track option for security but this was roped off for our flight. No lounge was offered even though there are lounges available and used by other airlines. Not surprisingly there was no priority boarding. Our seats 2D and 2E are the only decent seats in the new Club Europe. Service on board was adequate.

The seats themselves are quite comfortable and having storage at the top of the seats mean you don't lose your legroom. The service on board was excellent friendly staff both ways provided with a wrap roll cheese and biscuits and a chocolate mousse both ways return not as nice as outbound and they offer complimentary drinks. Looking at business class all you get is the middle seat free and no extra legroom a lounge and a hot meal so wouldn't think it's worth the upgrade fee anymore (having travelled many times in club with BA new product is not a winner from what I could see).

Positives : Small cabin between 1st class and Business makes it very exclusive and quiet (747 config 1) with no through traffic of other passengers. Upgraded service - welcome drink newspaper hot towel menu noise cancelling headphones upgraded blanket and much better food than economy (steak) bread selection etc. One flight attendant for the whole cabin but he was super efficient.

Very welcoming instantly struck up a conversation with me this person was a credit to the company and a much needed one. The good experience ended there. Punctuality reared it's ugly head once more. I've recorded this repeatedly. Departure was delayed 45 minutes. Not the end of the world but an inconvenience which happens so regularly I can pretty much count on it. It's a shame BA can't address these issues and get flights operating to schedule the majority of the time as other airlines are well able to. Once on board BA is like a tale of two airlines. Some crews are excellent others just lack professionalism and behave rather strangely at times. Possibly this may stem from the two tier or mixed fleet system. But whatever the issue may be crew quality and service is inconsistent. When we landed at Newcastle a crew member announced that the flight was only 30 minutes behind schedule! Well marvellous not in my opinion.

Firstly the First cabin was not clean (at all) with debris on the floor food still in the seat - it's pretty pathetic when you have to spend 5 minutes cleaning your area when you board! The food - the food can only be described as truly awful! To be honest I would be complaining if I received this standard of food in economy - the starter was a watery oily leek and potato soup and for the main two small lamb chops overdone in gravy with 6 tiny potatoes that deflated when pierced with a fork. I did not bother with desert! Afternoon tea served up (probably) the worst patisserie I have ever had the displeasure of tasting - completely inedible. The cabin crew were good and pleasant however I was not offered any bottled water for a 10 hour flight. It would seem to me that BA are a budget airline trying to do luxury and failing horribly. Surely management cannot be happy with their current standards but I am struggling to see any level of improvement (I take at least 1 first class international flight every year).

Arrived at airport for a flight to Nice and learnt it was 1.5 hours late - with arriving aircraft nowhere in sight. Prior flight was boarding (also delayed) Having no luggage checked and seats available I thought I might get to Nice after all in time. No such luck. Whilst the flight continued to board for another 15 minutes I spent arguing with BA staff to even check whether they could get me on the flight. First class lounge staff refused to call the gate. All with ""flight is finalized"". In similar situations with other airlines (most notably Lufthansa) they always re-opened the flight and got me on. The only excuse was ""it's the rules"" (obviously BA). Staff in addition took calls whilst handling my - urgent - request further delaying the process. If I have a choice I will definitely use other airlines. In addition they have changed the seating in Europe to come more in line with Easyjet and Ryanair. At 6""4 very uncomfortable.

D J Downing,United Kingdom,18th March 2015,No Trip Verified Status,British Airways business class is outclassed by rivals. The lay out of the seats needs sorting - I do not expect people to step over me when I have my seat extended in order to get out of their seating area. The inflight food was poor. Drinks were offered occasionally - 3/4 times on a ten hour flight - slightly warm coffee - ran out of ice. The idea that you have a selection of food to choose from in the business class galley was a joke. Non business class passengers used business class toilet and then helped themselves to the food. Inflight entertainment very poor. The terrace lounge at Gatwick is outdated - no hot food apart from porridge (we checked in at 9.00am) a few pieces of cold toast plus the usual cold meats and cheese. Booking business class with British Airways is definitely not worth the money.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Business Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,2,1,0,0,2,no
Clive V Drake,United Kingdom,17th March 2015,No Trip Verified Status,LHR-PISA-LHR. I have a house in Tuscany so fly there often. I used to fly a certain yellow/blue/white budget carrier from Stansted but got fed up at being treated like an inconvenience and that the FA's consistently spoke poor English. As a Silver card holder my wife and I enjoyed a nice breakfast in the lounge. It was not busy. We were seated in the exit rows which I selected before we left. It was better than the Club Europe space I had last month - which is why I bought economy as opposed to Club which I feel represents very poor value. The plane was a nice new A320 with the new seats. It was spotless. We had a nice snack on both flights + a few Gin and Tonics for me ! (the wife was driving on arrival) The FAs were great. Friendly and treated us like customers - not like cattle. Funnily enough both flights pushed back early and arrived early. Flight home was a bit rough due to high winds around Pisa - and a re-assuring comment over the PA system was a thoughtful touch to nervous flyers - my wife included. All in all BA at its best. They either getting it right or spectacularly wrong. There never appears to be anything in the middle.

Robin Middleton,United Kingdom,4th March 2015,No Trip Verified Status,Recently flew to EZE and back from LHR. Longest flight on the BA network. In each direction the crew were brilliant and nothing was too much trouble. IFE rather dated and choices were only average. Food was ok better than last year on this route. Actually had a very tasty steak out of EZE which was pink great! But full English breakfast is best avoided the continental choice was excellent. On schedule both ways and landed 30 minutes early both ways. Baggage arrived very promptly. For once there were no long queues at EZE. (Buenos Aires). I fly this route perhaps twice a year 3 years ago it was all pretty diabolical but despite cutbacks crew all seem much more friendly and the food is slowly improving.

Louise Robinson,United Kingdom,24th February 2015,No Trip Verified Status,"I have always travelled BA and have recently been upgraded to bronze which I would have thought had a few perks? Wrong! My 15 year old son and I travelled from LHR-NYC on BA but it was a code-share with American Airlines. I couldn't check in online so we stood in the long queue and couldn't book an aisle seat either. BA at the airport apparently couldn't help because it was a code-share even though I had bought through BA! The flight was on time and seats a reasonable size. Coming back we flew from Washington Dulles airport - there was a snow storm and it was freezing. The plane which was an Airbus 380 was supposed to leave at 6.35pm and showing departing ""on time"" not until 6.15 pm on the 21st Feb. Then BA Announced a 20 min delay which sounded reasonable considering the weather outside and all the other planes were delayed or cancelled! We were all boarded on the plane when they announced the plane was too heavy to be pushed out and there was too much snow behind the plane so they called the snow ploughs! We sat on the plane for 6 hours with no food or refreshments except water! There was nowhere for us go apparently so we couldn't get off the plane. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out that with all the snow and a huge airplane that there would be large problems. The final straw was after 5 hrs and the third attempt to move the plane was that we had to sit for another 45 mins defrosting the wings! British Airways were not prepared to cancel or reschedule the flight but instead made us sit like cattle on the airplane. It's a disgrace and we they will probably put it down to bad weather and not negligence bad planning or bad management on their part!

Carlos Blanco,United Kingdom,18th February 2015,No Trip Verified Status,LHR-CDG return. The outbound flight was ok. Nothing special as always. The seats are the new fitted seats for European flight. The meal was abysmal compared to AF. The return flight was really annoying. One of the FA was rude. He looked bored and tired as it was the last flight of the day. He showed no interest in collecting the used cups. I know it was a short flight but it was just unacceptable.

V Pervaaz,United States,11th February 2015,No Trip Verified Status,"I have been a loyal customer for the last 10 years and have progressively seen the service cleanliness and interest in client satisfaction decline. I just came back from a NYC-LHR-Dubai trip and will not fly BA again. Several reasons: my seat in Business Class was noticeably filthy - crumbs on the seat and hair on my pillow. When I told the attendant she just fluffed the pillow and walked away. I was hounded for not filling out the breakfast form in 5 minutes (the plane had not even taken off) and told that ""I would not get breakfast"". I was served raw chicken and when I expressed interest in another dish was told that all the other passengers had eaten and that there were no more dishes on the plane? The dish was taken away but no follow up or apologies - not even an extra bag of nuts to ensure that I was not hungry for the 7.5 hr flight. Perhaps the most disturbing part of traveling with BA is that the staff are unapologetically arrogant disinterested and unapproachable and any response is as if they are doing you a favor. As a customer paying nearly 10000 USD for a round trip ticket I shouldn't be afraid to speak to staff and highlight a dirty seat or food that is not cooked.

A Pascale,United States,28th January 2015,No Trip Verified Status,"Flew back from Milan LIN on Jan 4th. Because of ""mist"" (the pilot's actual characterization) most flights that morning had been delayed/canceled in/out of LHR. No delay info given at check-in nor at gate. Upon boarding the captain informed us that because of ""mist"" we were being held on the ground for 2 hours. My connecting flight to SFO was 2.5 hrs after landing in LHR. Flight attendant assured me most flights were being delayed therefore mine to SFO most likely too. Upon landing in LHR a sea of canceled/delayed lost souls. I was immediately told I was forced to miss my connection because my flight to SFO was on time. I was forced to join the longest line I've ever seen for rebooking. It never moved. We were told another set of rebooking desks were available upstairs ""and faster"". Crossing the border control took just as long. Upstairs it took me 5 hours just to get closer to the desks but still at least a couple hours away. I finally managed to join the free wifi and call BA's office to get rebooked online. I was rebooked on a flight from SFO to LHR. The wrong way around. When I pointed out the obvious the agent told me there was a ""computer glitch"" and promised to call me back. She finally called me back and got rebooked on AA flights to JFK and to SFO from there. The next morning at the AA check in they could not check me in on the JFK-SFO because of ""issues with the BA ticket"". It took 90 minutes and multiple interactions with 3 different desks to get it solved. I nearly missed the flight to JFK too. My suitcase was never loaded on that flight and I didn't get it at JFK.

I never travel economy class so it was a bit of an eye opener particularly on a 12 hour flight. The seats are far too close together and quite uncomfortable. In the middle seat the drop down tray was broken. When the passenger in front put his seat back I couldn't use the tray and when I asked the stewardess to ask him to put it forward a bit she just shrugged and said nothing.

The flight from Manchester was delayed and then on arrival at LHR the boarding passes which were fine at MAN were no good at LHR. We had to queue for over 2 hours to get more printed. Others with the same problem missed their main flights! The staff at LHR are rude jobsworth who take great pleasure in causing the maximum discomfort. The 747 seats on the LHR to LV flights were terrible like small deck chairs. Any leg/knee movement from the person behind was felt even with the pillow between me and the seat back. Compared with US Air the seats are much smaller and far more basic. Seating totally unsuitable for long haul flights. The entire cabin is extremely cramped the aisles are so narrow that anyone who is not slim tends to bang into your seat every time they pass. BA brought a whole new meaning to ""cattle class"" The cabin staff were efficient and professional the food was fine. I am not a large person certainly not overweight but I was badly cramped.

M Gibson,United Kingdom,19th January 2015,No Trip Verified Status,San Diego-LHR-MAN. On 6th January we flew from San Diego to Manchester UK via Heathrow. After flying out on Christmas Day via LAX on the A380 this flight was a welcome return to form for BA's Club World offering. The San Diego Admiral's Club lounge is currently undergoing refurbishment but is still a nice space and unlike the UK lounges upon arrival we were offered a menu not just a 'self serve' buffet. When it came time to board this was a much smoother experience than our previous flight on the A380 the staff at San Diego had the boarding area well organised and once club passengers were called we were on the aircraft glass of bubbly in hand in minutes. The cabin crew were much friendlier and professional than those on the outward flight as this is smaller cabin with fewer passengers you definitely felt that you were the 'premium' customer your ticket price would suggest and nothing was too much trouble. Drinks were constantly topped up food was excellent and the cabin crew were chatty and friendly. The entertainment system might not have been quite as impressive as on the A380 but considering we slept for a large portion of this 10 hour flight that was unimportant. After a very average outward flight on the A380 into LA this superb flight home on the smaller aircraft restored my faith in BA's club offering and means that for future trips to the West Coast we will be flying direct into San Diego rather than LAX.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Business Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,5,5,0,0,5,yes
Worcester David,United Kingdom,19th January 2015,No Trip Verified Status,LHR-HKG-LHR in First. A brief trip to celebrate New Year in Honkers. Pleasant First class check in average Fast Track and warm welcome in the Concorde Room. Escorted to a table for 3. Excellent meal and service. My salmon tartare was nice enough and the Lamb was very tender rounded off by a sticky toffee and date pudding which was good but next time more clotted cream please. I enjoyed a couple of glasses of champagne and a nice pinot noir. Boarded at C64 escorted to my seat after a very warm personal welcome. Champagne slippers pj's and an amenity kit proffered. Crew seem excellent. They will also bring us home on New Year's day. After take off drinks (bloody mary for me) and an amuse-bouche. My friends indulged in a full meal but I just had the Cauliflower Soup which was very tasty. My friend's Profiteroles looked yummy. The crew were very attentive to us all. After being taken on a tour of the 777 by Kim I slept for 4 hours or so before indulging in a full English. Got changed before landing. An excellent flight with an excellent crew. Coming home. After a pleasant supper in the Qantas lounge we were escorted to the front of the queue and welcomed on board by our now familiar crew. Champagne settled us down and after take off my dinner was predicated with an amuse-bouche of beef carpaccio prawn and balik salmon with olive oil caviar followed by lamb washed down with a rather nice Medoc with a cheese plate conclusion. After a good night's sleep I woke to a cup of English Breakfast tea and orange juice whilst my friends had the full works. Quick disembarkation.

Given the cost of the ticket we would have bought that bottle many many times over. I like to watch movies or the map of our progress and on a flight of over 8 hours this is important to me. You guessed it the video system did not work at all for me nor for several other customers around me. I did complain and have been offered compensation of £60 but only against the cost of another BA ticket.

I've travelled with BA for the past 30 years. When on business I travel business class and when on personal travel it varies between economy and club - depending on distance and budget. This year I travelled to Toronto on vacation and were assigned economy seats on the new Dreamliner. We chose not to upgrade seats as the Dreamliner blurb gushed about seat space. How foolish we were. At just 5'7"" and 5'4"" respectively we are not in any way shape or form giants. But the absolute honest truth is we were squashed in tight. The restricted space was possibly not so much the leg room but the seat width - but letting the table down for food/drink was snug. Outside of the seat space issue everything else was superb. Inflight entertainment equipment was familiar easy to use. Boarding in UK and Toronto was smooth and helpful ground staff were always visible and proactive in offering and helping passengers.

C Down,United Kingdom,1st December 2014,No Trip Verified Status,LHR-HKG B777 Club World. I was lucky enough to book a window seat at the back of the club world cabin which meant that I had direct aisle access without stepping over someone else's feet or them mine and my meals did not need to be passed over the person next to me. I found the seat very comfortable and while it is slightly narrower than others it has a lot of flexibility with the foot stool and the reclining options. The backward/forward facing seats is not ideal although did not upset me as much as others. As I was travelling with a friend the potentially awkward intimacy was not an issue. IFE was excellent with a large good quality screen and an extensive library of films and TV. Food was fairly disappointing possibly hindered by an hour delay on departure although really they should be resilient to that. Drinks and service were both very good British Airways offer a very efficient and professional service although it is not always overtly friendly. Personally I like this but it could be seen as a negative depending on peoples expectations. Galleries Lounge in LHR T5 was excellent. Peaceful and comfortable with a good selection of drinks and reasonable food. Overall it was a solid product and one which I look forward to flying again.

Positives were all flights on time and crews were overall great on all sectors. Was able to upgrade return at check in at DXB for about $1000 which I thought was worth it. I was not too impressed with WTP product - I still had to pay to get assigned seats which is ridiculous when you are paying extra anyway. The 747 the product looks old and tired. Menu is the same as economy even though they advertise that catering includes a business class entree. Catering out of LHR was absolutely atrocious - almost like a TV dinner which is strange as this is their main hub. Return in Club world was a decent product. Lounge had hot breakfast and was quite big and food onboard was reasonable. Second meal service (high tea) was a joke with pre-packaged sandwiches - not too classy.

One of the most comfortable economy class flights I have had despite the fact the seating was on the more cramped side. The ambience of the cabin was very calming and soothing and the service from the young crew members enthusiastic pleasant and courteous. Managed to sleep 6 hours made the 13 hour shorter. Food was delicious and water runs in between meals very helpful to keep us hydrated. Compared to Air France which is self service appreciated that BA crew does the water runs. One complaint is the entertainment system which featured touch screen did not work on my seat but small matter. Overall a very relaxing soothing pleasant smooth flight made the 13 hours fly by quickly.

Clive V Drake,United Kingdom,17th November 2014,No Trip Verified Status,LAX/LHR. The flight started badly with the lounge facilities (or lack of) at LAX. There is no First Class lounge anymore – and worst still its a communal Business/First facility shared by BA Qantas and Cathay Pacific. Two hours before my flight it was a zoo. Rammed with around 300 passengers from 3 flights. The food and beverages was to a very high standard. There was no separated boarding lines for First passengers. Flight left on time and dinner was an ordinary affair. A poached salmon starter was neither here or there. Luke warm soup. A rather nice but not exceptional Italian style chicken dish. All served with cheap canteen style cutlery - long gone is the nice silver-plated cutlery they used to offer. Wines were fine. Turn down bed service reminded me of why I don't like the new BA First class seat. The silliest aspect has to be that you either have a seat or a bed – and no adjustable foot rest. In bed mode and mainly thanks to the design of the centre console housing the table - the bed is to narrow. I am 6 4” tall and not overweight. It's very awkward and uncomfortable. BA in old first I am sure use to give you a foldable mattress – now they don't. You get a thin duvet. This makes the bed incredible hard; and during turbulence its a hard uncomfortable to ride. I don't think I slept more than an hour in the whole flight. The tight confines of the compartment means you have to be a gymnast to get in and out when in bed mode. This fare is sometimes as much as £7000 – one way and it's not worth it. What amazes me in the competitive world that BA operate is that they don't seem to look at the competition. They trumpet they are the best and yet they are not. Mind you on the LAX route the only alternative is AA – and they have little ideas on quality in First Class. When I look at what SIA Emirates (the best in my view) and Etihad offer BA do not come close. BA often charge more than anyone else for a frequently inferior product. In fact over the last ten years the prices have sky-rocketed and the quality and standards have sky rocketed as well - downwards!,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,First Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,4,2,0,0,2,no
Ross Kelly,United Arab Emirates,11th November 2014,No Trip Verified Status,I flew from MIA-LHR-DXB. The 747 like most of their crew is well passed its sell by date. The business cabin is tired and worn IFE below standard seats are ok but nothing great. My biggest gripe were the crew on the second leg. We were in upper deck and found them quite inattentive and everything felt like a hassle but the best was to come. My wife and I had a sleep after dinner when we woke 2 hours before arrival we decided to have a drink. I pressed the call bell and ordered a baileys and a glass of wine. I was first told that the bar had closed which was nonsense after I complained they sent down a supervisor where a long argument presumed in which they basically told myself and my wife we were too intoxicated to have anymore drink! The way they spoke to us was both condescending and humiliating and after all of this on clearly seeing we were nowhere near intoxicated they served us another drink. As a seasoned traveler I have never been spoken to like this before. We flew American in Business on the way to MIA and in stark contrast the business cabin was excellent on the new 777-300 and the crew were only too happy to serve you. BA really need to have a look at themselves your crew by large seem to have an attitude problem see the paying passenger as an inconvenience rather they a valued customer. With such choice from Dubai I will never travel BA again. If you want to pay thousands for a worn out badly designed seat to be insulted by crew who will go out of there way not to serve you book BA otherwise do yourself a favour and go with an airline that doesn't employ over unionised staff that take pleasure in being rude to passengers.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Business Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,1,2,0,0,2,no

Both ways on 747-400 aircraft both times aircraft were tired and in need of updating/repairs. On the outbound flight bits of foam fillers hanging down on bulkhead wall. On return window blind broken/stuck. Also on both aircraft the IFE needed to be re-booted shortly after take-off and was very ancient compared to other airlines. Both aircraft's were very warm before engine start. The outbound plane cooled down but the return remained uncomfortably warm - opening airvents had little effect. Very rowdy passengers on outbound flight but no action taken by the crew other than to stop serving drinks to the whole cabin for a period. On return flight crew seemed in a hurry to complete dinner service - hardly allowing enough time to eat food before returning to collect trays. Food was good on both flights. Overall the flights were on time and the seats were comfortable (but difficult to get out of if the one in front was reclined). The service was functional but not particularly warm or friendly.

K Nicol,United Kingdom,31st October 2014,No Trip Verified Status,LAX to LHR - 25 Oct 2014. I agree with other reviewers that Business Class on the A380 is too crowded. I am a frequent business traveller to LAX and if I had the choice I would rather be on the upper deck of the 747. The seats and small storage drawer (if you are on the aisle) feel cheap. Service levels seem to be dropping in terms of drinks before dinner (1 instead of 2) and no attention to top up during the meal. My main course of fish was inedible due to being overcooked. The staff seem grumpy about the smaller galley size (can't blame them). We flew First on the outbound to LAX which of course was better although the cabin feels quite sterile.

To make matters worse Prem Economy passengers had been bumped up to Club World and were enjoying A/B seats - total joke.

Suhail Shafi,United States,22nd October 2014,No Trip Verified Status,I recently flew on British Airways long haul on a flight from Philadelphia to New Delhi havinh not having travelled with British Airway for around a decade. I had been a huge fan of British Airways in the past and was very curious to see how their inflight product and entertainment had changed in that time. I also was curious to see Heathrow's new Terminal 5. British Airway's overall product has improved in that time. On the first leg from Philadelphia to London I was very happy to notice the new seats with excellent comfort with adjustable headrests and new Audio Video on Demand (AVOD) entertainment systems. I had been travelling with noise cancelling headphones which made the experience a thoroughly enjoyable one. Inflight entertainment system is sophisticated and I enjoyed their World music section in particular. The Asian vegetarian meals was of a high standard for the most part. My only criticism in this area was that on the second meal (breakfast) we only were served a fruit platter and had to ask for the croissants everyone else were given. In addition I found the chapatis on the Delhi-London sector to be hard as rocks. Otherwise the meals were very good. Terminal 5 is a gem of an airport but the true highlight of the journey was on the London-Philadelphia sector when I had the opportunity to fly on the Dreamliner. The plane is a marvel. The windows are huge dimmable by button too. The bathrooms are larger than usual and the flight was very smooth. Additionally the legroom on the Dreamliner is impressive - an improvement on the B777. And finally a word about the cabin attendants. Their level of friendliness varies from person to person but for the most part they represent the best traditions of British hospitality - informal politeness. All in all I was happy with my BA trip and they continue to perform as one of my favourite airlines.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Economy Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,5,4,0,0,5,yes

Asked for another glass of wine twice with my main the stewardess forgot and denied that I had even asked for one. Food going out was pretty good but coming home just awful. I for one can just not get my head round the seat formation. You stare at some stranger on take off and landing food and drinks for passengers on the inner seats are pushed in front of your face.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Business Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,2,3,0,0,3,no
J Weber,United States,12th October 2014,No Trip Verified Status,We flew BA from London to Dulles DC 10/8/2014.

P Wylie,Australia,12th October 2014,No Trip Verified Status,Took 6 BA flights as part of a OneWorld RTW trip. JFK to Berlin via LHR then 4 days later Berlin to MAN via LHR and 6 weeks later Nice to DXB again via LHR. All flights on time all cabin crew polite attentive and thoroughly professional. Refreshments meals and drinks all appropriate for the flights and times of day. It was a pleasure to fly BA after 5 flights with AA. Just one small attitude problem with a ground agent at LHR while boarding for DXB. We were snapped at and told to wait while other passengers (presumably business class) boarded. We were not in the business class 'line' but just happened to be standing near one of the two gates where boarding passes were checked. The ground agent obviously thought that we were economy class passengers trying to board early. Overall a 99% satisfactory rating for these flights. Did not use IFE so unable to give a rating.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Business Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,5,5,0,0,5,yes
J Wer,United Kingdom,5th October 2014,No Trip Verified Status,Traveled to Rome with British Airways. On the way there everything went fine. A day before our departure we were told that the flight was overbooked and asked politely to change to a different flight. We were told that they would pay for the taxi (the flight was earlier and no public transport was available.) as well as for the breakfast that we were missing at our hotel. We agreed to change because we sympathized with BA representative who had a difficult job of asking people to move to a different flight and because we wanted to support British Airways. Big mistake. Apparently everything we were told by their representative was a lie and no refund for the taxi fare was given to us. So much for doing BA a favor they are not a reputable company they once were.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Economy Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,2,3,0,0,1,no
Derek Salter,South Africa,1st October 2014,No Trip Verified Status,Economy from LAX to CPT via LHR. Airbus 380 on first leg 747 on second. Both flights completely full. Airbus quiet - on upper deck with a window seat. Room underseat very limited due to two entertainment boxes but storage by window as compensation. For a new plane seat isn't very comfortable - rather hard and I prefer the old-style head rest on the 747s. Great entertainment screen. 747 seat v comfortable and softer but plane is showing its age and noisy after a 380 flight and the seat back screens smaller than many phones these days. Staff on 380 v helpful and pleasant - more functional on the CPT leg. Special meal not provided on last section of CPT leg - otherwise provided and edible. Boarding easy at LAX more chaotic with less waiting area space at Heathrow - they really didn't plan the waiting areas well at Heathrow - just too cramped and poor layout. And transferring through from section c to section a and then back to section b at Heathrow is a real pain and the shuttle was very full too so would avoid if possible. Otherwise flights on time at both destinations despite leaving late. Heathrow is the main drawback when using BA and transferring - what a shame that they didn't make it easier when planning the new terminal. LAX was a joy to use in comparison - so smooth and staff extremely pleasant and helpful despite having a poor reputation.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Economy Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,4,4,0,0,4,yes
Clive Drake,United Kingdom,28th September 2014,No Trip Verified Status,LHR-Hannover Germany. You really wonder sometimes with BA. I paid £940 return and what a joke. (Last year I flew Stuttgart and Berlin in Club for about££600 and was very happy). Firstly the flight ran from T1 at LHR. T5 Club lounge is rather good. On first sight the T1 lounge looked OK. I arrived at 15.03 and was told hot food was not available after 3pm. With a bit of grovelling I managed to get a plate of Singapore Chicken curry from the waitress. The whole food area consisted of a few miserable sandwich's peanuts and a miserable looking soup. Drinks ok. Flight was an A319 which left about 40 minutes late. Couldn't be bothered to eat the Prawn salad - which actually looked ok. FA's were fine. In summary a real big BA con. Flight was one hour and at £450+ per hour it costs more than a 7 hour flight in First to JFK. A miserable experience.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Business Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,3,3,0,0,1,no
Debbie Donnelly,United Kingdom,18th September 2014,No Trip Verified Status,Used BA for a return trip to Denver and was very disappointed.

Simon Brown,United Kingdom,17th September 2014,No Trip Verified Status,I have flown LHR-BKK many times with EVA Emirates Oman and Qatar. Unfortunately this time I chose my National carrier. Disappointed is not the word. To start with the seating arrangement is absurd. All the others manage 1-2-1 or 2-2-2. BA manages 6 abreast in a horrible tight arrangement whereby you face your neighbour. When the hot towels were given out they were like warm rags in comparison to the other airlines. Food - ok there was a selection on the menu. However at service time I was merely passed a tray over my neighbour. On every Qatar flight you are not only addressed by your name but the table is made for you as if being in a 5* restaurant. None of this with BA. Once the appetiser and first course are consumed you hand the bowls back to the attendent who then passes your main course to you in a bowl. Shabby is not the word. After a reasonable sleep in a very narrow bed it was time for landing. With no sign of a priority immigration pass being given I asked the steward for one. He replied they did not have any for this flight but assured me there would be ground staff at the gate to supply this basic amenity. Stupidly I believed him. Upon departure at BKK no ground staff or passes. I return to the UK next week and for the first time ever I am dreading the experience. Never ever will I fly my national carrier again. Disgraceful. It's any Middle East airline again for me. Qatar being my preferred choice.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Business Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,3,3,0,0,3,no
S Parikh,United Kingdom,9th September 2014,No Trip Verified Status,Just came back this morning on a flight from Dubai - BA106. I was not impressed. The cabin crew were just not friendly or helpful. The plane was very old and so were the crew tired and old. It look like they had just got the bad bunch of hostesses to manage this flight. BA was so particular before what's happened? The cabin was very hot and several times my wife asked about it and she was just ignored. The food was very quickly given out many of times people were missed. I have to ask for water a number of times. There was no genuine warmth. It was really like flying on a 3 class air lines. I'd love to fly BA and support them but this is appalling. I would not recommended this - Next time we are flying eremites. Pay the extra.

Monique Melis,United Kingdom,6th September 2014,No Trip Verified Status,When will they learn. I flew BA to Dubai last Friday in business. Let me sum it up. Boring food surly crew dirty plane and expensive. Can the product get any more unimaginative. The inflight entertainment was out of touch with modern media the screen so poor I couldn't see the movie and gave up. The sandwiches that you get when you land are so awful that I think any frequent flyer is awfully fed up with them the crew make you feel that you are in their way and the plane is (again) horribly dirty. Coffee was spilt on all the wipeable areas around my seat. In business you expect better. It is just not an enjoyable or fun experience by any means and they never upgrade you or take care of their frequent flyers.

Debbie Nicol,United Kingdom,1st September 2014,No Trip Verified Status,LGW-MCO-LGW 11-25th August Economy Class. Got to the gate lounge to be told our seats has been reallocated to another seat this was the reason why - it was because there was a big family party that didn't want to separate - considering I paid a lot of money for my family to sit all together. Got on to the plane thinking it would be the same as Virgin Atlantic but no it wasn't it was an old plane tatty one as well. Food and drinks were limited on the whole 9 hour flight no snacks on board. The food was limited and when we got ours the people in front decide to recline there chairs in front so within that we have told hold our dinners luckily we didn't get burnt.

David Paton,United Kingdom,26th August 2014,No Trip Verified Status,On 28th July flew from Edinburgh to Gatwick. Flight was delayed 3 hours as it had been hit by lightening on the flight this we accepted but what happened afterwards means I will never use them again. 1) Information or details of what was happening had to bedraggled out of them. 2) At no time was any refreshment offered. 3) The flight was further delayed to allow people to transfer back onto this flight when they choose to be transferred to a later flight rather than wait to see what was happening this lead to a further delay of 1 hour. 4) No breakfast or snack was served for health and safety reasons. 5) Although they stated we would be well hydrated during the flight only one drink service was provided this consisted of 4 fluid oz cup of water between 7.00am and 2.30pm. 6) They then proceeded to leave our luggage at Edinburgh while we travelled to Gatwick. 7) After giving us the run around for an hour and a half they then decided to tell us they could not track our bags. 8) It then took them two days to locate them and send them from Edinburgh to Gatwick.

Aircraft 777-200. Got a complimentary upgrade from World Traveler to World Traveler Plus. The seat was good and spacious service was professional and the food was nice especially the English breakfast that was served prior to landing. The only drawback was the absence of overhead air vents which at times made it a little stuffy and the in-flight entertainment which lacked the variety of Emirates for example.

G Fox,United Kingdom,11th August 2014,No Trip Verified Status,Flight from Heathrow to Newark. The new Dreamliner was fantastic. Very comfortable quiet and clean. The cabin crew were superb very professional with customer service being their priority. I appreciate that flying on a new aircraft makes a difference to the flight however if BA continue to invest in their fleet and maintain and excellent level of customer service I can see no other reason to fly with another carrier especially when considering BA's avios points usage which allows all of your points to be spent on flights. Virgin however dictate how many points you can spend on each flight. I've flown with BA and Virgin many times it was a nice attempt by Virgin advertising themselves in terminal 5 however when you're sat in terminal 5 after experiencing a quick and easy run through the terminal about to board a brand new aircraft it's hard to see the advertisements working.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Economy Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,5,5,0,0,5,yes

London City a delight to travel through except when your flight is badly delayed which sadly ours was. No announcements made to tell anyone what was happening 2 hour delay shown on the departure board popped up at boarding time. Actually a BA fan but this was handled very badly. No information or assistance. Then when we boarded we were delayed by another hour thankfully once on board the cabin crew and pilots were great at communicating and almost made up for the bad handling by ground staff. Great hot breakfast and drinks served on board on the way out. The return flight was on time and again a lovely crew and a very acceptable snack and drink service. Excellent value compared to the ""low cost"" carriers no extra charges for bags etc allowed and free drinks if you wanted them. Apart from the delay outbound a wonderful trip.

Livingston Alan,United Kingdom,8th July 2014,No Trip Verified Status,I flew Glasgow-Gatwick-Vegas-Gatwick-Glasgow. I have flown this way before as I get to put my baggage on at Glasgow and forget about it. Glasgow-Gatwick no real comment other than cabin crew don't do much more than the minimum. Flew Premium Economy on a 777-200 flight was full. Premium cabin is cramped and a fair distance away from the Toilets as you are not allowed to use the toilets at the front again cabin crew do no more than the minimum food just about acceptable. Return flight of the same standard they kept trying to say I was booked back to Edinburgh took them an age to sort this out breakfast is a bit of a joke have found when flying BA that its best to carry snacks as they don't over feed you. Of course when I got back to Gatwick I ran into the French ATC control strike no announcement made. After having to hang around Gatwick all day I finally got a flight to Glasgow at 8pm at least my luggage arrived well done to BA there. When I made a comment to BA customer service I was told by them that my flight(s) had been cancelled due to Aircraft unserviceability when I queried this the respondent confirmed that aircraft u/s could offer no explanation as to why I was told different.

J Kain,United Kingdom,6th July 2014,No Trip Verified Status,Flying from Aberdeen to Toronto via LHR. On board the new 787s on this route you can really notice the difference that they make over the 777. No drying of the eyes or popping of the ears thanks to the good air system. Although a little cramped in economy on the outbound journey I was able to secure a bulkhead seat on the overnight back. I would definitely recommend this as value for money over eco+. Just buy the economy ticket and pay to have a front row seat (there is more leg room and the same service from what I saw). The small commuter plane from ABZ to LHR and back was starting to feel pretty old and tired by comparison to the 787 however the cabin crew did a great job shoehorning in a full meal service in less than an hour.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Economy Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,5,4,0,0,4,yes

Veggie meal ordered was given to someone else by mistake so I had to have fish. Video screen is tiny on these planes - not that it mattered as the system wasn't working properly so I couldn't watch any films. Pretty poor on a 9.5 hour flight.

When we were seated we were offered champagne and we organized our belongings quickly. I sat down got out my magazine and asked the flight attendant how to operate the light and she apologized that our seats had no power and they have been working on it. Well after about ten minutes the door closed and the plane pushed off and I inquired again about the issue and she said the pilot was working on it. The power never came on during the 10.5 hour flight. We had no lights no entertainment no seat adjustments.

Outbound spoilt by an hour or so delay when boarded as they decided to change one of the wheels glad they did though. Return yesterday not so good as flight again delayed by about one and a half hours but no real explanation. I realise people want to sleep but they can be so inconsiderate at times. No sooner in their seats and fully reclined. Meal was just adequate curried chicken but breakfast of a very hard croissant with jam a nutty bar some dried cranberries and coffee was not what I really wanted after a delayed 9 hour flight.

S Lewis,United Kingdom,9th June 2014,No Trip Verified Status,"We travelled Club Europe from Gatwick to Paphos as we were going out to get married. The extra luggage was handy due to the dress and all the extras that we needed to take but we could have paid for the extra space at much less a cost. As it was our wedding we decided to treat ourselves and go the full hog so spent nearly £1000 extra on Club Europe seats expecting to get a really good experience. Check in was quick and easy but there was no queue at the normal check in either so we didn't really benefit from that. The lounge was nothing particularly impressive although we didn't get there with much time to spare so that was more our fault. We were let on the plane first through the front of the plane the problem was that the rest of the passengers also came through the same door and through the Club Europe section so to be able to put our bags up into the compartment I had to stand by my seat until the entire plane had boarded. The seating then was just a row of 3 seats with the middle seat blocked off so although there was ""extra room"" it wasn't what I'd have expected. Our bags were marked as priority with the tags but came out with the rest of the luggage. I don't know if we went in expecting more than we should have but for the extra money we paid I think we were entitled to have higher expectations. Not an ideal way to start our wedding experience.

Shiva Raman,Australia,1st June 2014,No Trip Verified Status,Dublin to Sydney (via Heathrow and Singapore). Club Europe from Dublin to London and club world to Sydney. Flight to Heathrow delayed 40 mins due to weather which was fine. Upon arrival in Heathrow waited for an hour for the bus transfer leaving us 30 mins to make the next flight. Upon boarding the connection bus another 30 mins delayed. By this time it was about 10pm. Obviously missed the connecting flight to Sydney so tried to find a BA contact in terminal 4. Was then advised to go to terminal 1. No BA reps around and no 24 hr phone number. Then transferred to terminal 5. By this time it was midnight and still no BA contacts. Finally went to baggage services and saw a BA rep that had no idea what was going on and sent us to the first class lounge which was closed. Finally someone appeared at 1am who sorted out our hotel room and as the delay was caused by BA they provided us with the option of flying back to Sydney on BA or could see if they could get us on a China Southern flight (we had originally booked China Southern). We took the BA option as it was easiest and needed to come home. Next day arrived at airport and boarded through Gate C in terminal 5 (hate Heathrow airport). Lounge in Heathrow was fine over crowded but fine. Upon boarding the BA business class product we were very disappointed to say the least. Seats old aircraft old and the seating configuration was awful. We had the two middle seats E and F which were facing backwards however the seats on opposite sides are very close facing towards you. Flight left on time and arrived in Singapore on time. There was a delay of an hour in Singapore but again that couldn't be helped. They were also out of the express passes which was annoying and also lost our baggage - luckily it arrived two days later. Good luck if you're expecting to sleep on the flight. Seats were small and very uncomfortable. The amenity kits were ok however they ran out of eye masks. The hit towels were anything but hot. Food was below average. Overall I wouldn't recommend British Airways Club Europe/world. The best I've experienced so far from Sydney to Europe would have to be on China Southern.

Amanda Hutchinson,United Kingdom,28th May 2014,No Trip Verified Status,My husband and I travelled to San Diego from Heathrow and back via JFK five weeks later. Service is appalling. Stewards are slightly more pleasant than the stewardesses who are particularly rude abrupt and lazy. Food is particularly foul and there was a long period of some hours (the flight to San Diego is 12 hours) without access to water or beverages. Dinner was produced a short time into the flight and a snack provided before landing. The journey from JFK was worse. Same problem with rude and disdainful stewardess. We paid extra for extra legroom at the front of the cabin and found more seats had been installed in front which resulted in such short room that my knees were touching the seat in front for the whole trip back. when the seat in front was reclined it was impossible to view the monitor in front of me. Dinner was pretty awful and the next meal: breakfast comprised of a near frozen croissant. The problem is staff. There needs to be a senior manager travelling on these routes in 'cattle class' incognito - then they will understand what it is like to be treated with complete disdain.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Economy Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,1,1,0,0,3,no
G Sims,United Kingdom,20th May 2014,No Trip Verified Status,Recently returned from Mauritius to Gatwick in Club World and have to say that the service was woefully lacking. Left on time. The cabin crew were obviously tired and the welcome glass of Champagne was served without smiles or a welcome. Throughout the whole flight the crew did the absolute minimum and there was very little interaction with the passengers. Breakfast was disgusting and served soon after take-off. A little round casserole dish of British Breakfast ingredients all piled together and searingly hot and overcooked and tasteless. Awful insipid coffee. After that some of the crew disappeared for a sleep and we were left to ourselves. Nobody asked if we wanted anything nobody chatted I rang for a drink and nobody came. The galley 'kitchen/snack bar' was almost bare and had two manky stale smoked-salmon sandwiches and a few bottles of water. On asking for a glass (there were none) for wine I was told to sit down and one would be brought as indeed it was ten minutes later with no smiles or nibbles. Throughout the flight I felt guilty asking for a G&T or wine because of the negative attitude of certain cabin crew. Lunch was just about OK and very good wine. After that for the next five hours nothing was served to refresh us before landing - no tea no cakes no nothing. The seating configuration was 2-4-2 (Boeing 777) and packed in like sardines - claustrophobic for some. To access the aisle from the window you have to climb over the legs of the person behind and the food is served across the lap of the aisle seat over the partition. We were a couple but if you are travelling alone it could make for some very strange eye-to-eye contact with a stranger. The IFE was dated and a very limited choice with poor quality fuzzy screens. The whole package was so minimal soulless and lacking. Not once were you made to feel special or 'pampered' in any way. If there is an alternative in future to BA I'll take it and compared with some Middle-East airlines the Club World product is embarrassingly mediocre. BA needs to refresh review and up-date quickly.

BA Galleries South for a quick spot of breakfast. Boarding started 20 minutes before departure. Not a full flight. Left slightly late due to cargo being loaded but arrived on time. Standard seating and food for BA short haul European flight. Return FRA-LCY on a E70 Row 15. Use of the JAL lounge at FRA opposite the gate area. Bus to the aircraft and an on-time departure. Full flight and not much room up above for carry on items on this aircraft on a full flight. Legroom quite tight in row 15. Again standard food and drink for a BA short haul service.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Economy Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,4,3,0,0,4,yes
Alan Clare,United Kingdom,7th May 2014,No Trip Verified Status,6 May 2014: Las Vegas to Gatwick. Boeing 777. Back on BA again thanks to Avios Companion coupon. Cabin crew are now more present throughout the journey but not experienced any of them going too far to please a customer it seems just okay if they run out of a meal choice or if friends not seated together. Certainly yesterday cleaning the wc was not on the duty list. I've flown AF TAP SWISS KLM long haul in the past year and by far BA catering in economy is the poorest in content. Yesterdays offering for Breakfast was almost an insult.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Economy Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,3,3,0,0,5,no
Michael Dielissen,Canada,29th August 2012,No Trip Verified Status,YYZ to LHR - July 2012 - I flew overnight in premium economy on a 767. I chose this flight because on the 767 the layout is 2-2-2. I chose an aisle seat in the middle 2 so I could go to the washroom etc without disturbing y seat ate and vice versa. The seats are comparable to North American business class except with narrower arm rests. (better than economy but still not meant for sharing). The entree food was the same as business class and I wasn't really impressed. It wasn't bad but wasn't good either. I would definitely fly BA on this route again mostly because of the layout and the option to fly premium economy.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Premium Economy,No Route,No Date Flown,1,3,3,0,0,4,yes
Avril Barclay,United Kingdom,12th October 2011,No Trip Verified Status,My son who had worked for British Airways urged me to fly British Airways to Kansas City. He recommended me to join the executive club. I went ahead and booked my flight back in May. Very reasonable price. As they are in an alliance with American Airlines my outward journey was with American Airlines. They were helpful even booking my seats to Chicago then onto Kansas at no cost. Problem was on my return. I duly waited to book my seat on the Chicago flight 24 hours prior to check-in. As this was with BA I tried for an hour to choose a seat to no avail. My itinerary came up but told me I was being redirected to American. So I called BA they told me I was to check in at Kansas City before I could have a seat assigned. So I called American a very unhelpful person told me that I had to go to back to BA. I called BA again after explaining I had seat booked with American from Kansas but could not get one with BA she put me on hold for 15 minutes and told me I had a seat - trouble was it was the one from Kansas to Chicago. Perhaps the powers that be can sort this out. It was most frustrating. The journey was fine staff polite in-flight entertainment excellent.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Economy Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,3,5,0,0,4,yes
